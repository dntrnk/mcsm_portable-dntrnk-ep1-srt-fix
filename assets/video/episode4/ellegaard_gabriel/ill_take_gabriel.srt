1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
I'll take Gabriel.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Then I've got Petra.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Whatever you do, don't look back.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ah! I look.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Watch out!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's gaining on us!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Pick up the pace or we're all done for!

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
First time on a horse here!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The end of the horsemanship, Jesse.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is that what this is called?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Jesse, look out!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
I'm going to get you!

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Am I seeing Enderman attack the weatherstorm?

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
Enderman move locks. It's what they do.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
There! We can get over there.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
We can be rich.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,500
Guys, come on!

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
We've got to build a new one, like right now.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Come on, faster!

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Yee-haw!

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Woo!

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
I saw you screaming in my ear.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We made it!

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We actually freaking made it!

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Hey, how are you feeling?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm just feeling a little bit better.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,500
I'm feeling better.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm feeling better.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm feeling better.

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm feeling better.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm feeling better.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm feeling better.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't really feel like myself.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
I still can't believe you're even alive.

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Do you not recognize us?

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm Axel. This is Olivia.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
We've been friends for a really long time.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
We've been friends for a really long time.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
We've been friends for a really long time.
