1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
I've got Petra!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,560
They don't take Gabriel!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,520
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,120
Whatever you do, don't look back!

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Ah! I look!

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Watch out!

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,320
It's gaining on us!

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,840
It's coming after us!

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Keep longer!

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,000
We can stop, please!

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Please!

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm doing the best I can.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Jesse, look out!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to get you!

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,520
Have I seen Enderman attack a weather storm?

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,200
Enderman move blocks. It's what they do.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,360
There! We can hide over there.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Guys, come on!

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,160
We've got to build a new one, like right now.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,280
Come on, faster!

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,560
Yee-haw!

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
I saw you screaming in my ear!

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Sorry.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
We made it!

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
We actually freaking made it!

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Hey, how are you feeling?

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
I'm fine.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm fine.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm fine.

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm fine.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm fine.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm fine.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm fine.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm fine.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,760
I don't really feel like myself.

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
I still can't believe you're even alive.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Do you not recognize us?

40
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm Axel. This is Olivia.

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,760
We've been friends for a really long time.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
We've been friends for a really long time.
