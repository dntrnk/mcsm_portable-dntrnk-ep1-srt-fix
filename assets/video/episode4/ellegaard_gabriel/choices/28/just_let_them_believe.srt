1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Don't tell them Gabriel, just let them have their legend.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,800
We all owe a great debt to Jesse and his friends.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,720
But I owe a debt to you people as well.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,920
Which is why...

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
There is something I want to tell you...

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
About the Order.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,840
We may have defeated the Ender Dragon,

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
But that is nothing compared to what these heroes did.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,040
They took down a wither storm.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,040
They are a new generation of heroes.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,240
Thank you, thank you everyone.

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,280
I know you think I'm up here because I saved the world or something,

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
But the truth is I didn't do it alone.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,120
Far from it.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
You see, I had my friends with me.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
It was Olivia, Axel, Petra, Lucas.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
They stood by my side right from the start.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,560
Well, and they made fun of me when I deserved it.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,080
That's just how we are.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,600
Dang right we are.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,680
It's crazy to think my friends and I started out in a tree house

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,640
And now we've been to some of the weirdest places in the world.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
I mean, come on, we went to the Far Lands.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Whoa!

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,560
There was this gigantic wall and a huge maze and a model of the Ender Dragon that was just a dream.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
Model of the Ender Dragon that, well, you just had to be there.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,720
But when all was said and done, you know what really mattered?
