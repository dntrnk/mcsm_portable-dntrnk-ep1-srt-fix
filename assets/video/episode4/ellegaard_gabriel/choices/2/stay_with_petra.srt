00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Petra, how are you doing? Are you remembering things yet?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
I... I don't know.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,200
These little flashes keep coming back to me, but then they float away again.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,200
We've been trying to talk to her, but...

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,600
It's like she's never met us before.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,600
I know I've met you before.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,800
Before today, I mean...

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,800
I just don't remember... how, exactly.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,900
You totally came to my rescue in the forest, remember?

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,900
I remember... a spider.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Yes, that's right!

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,100
And you needed me to kill it for you, right?

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
Hey, it took me by surprise.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,100
Yes, it's working! You're remembering Jesse!

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,900
Do you remember me, too?

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,700
No. And yet, I feel like I know all of you, somehow.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,900
Well, nobody forgets his ugly face.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,300
It's true, they don't.

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,500
Wait... didn't we all fight that wither thing together?

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,100
Yes! We totally did!

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
She remembers it!

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,300
I remember... running... to a... a temple in the woods, and...

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,300
we were gonna be safe there, and...

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,300
How did I end up... inside that thing?

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,100
Uh... well...

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Something bad happened there. I just... I can't remember what.
