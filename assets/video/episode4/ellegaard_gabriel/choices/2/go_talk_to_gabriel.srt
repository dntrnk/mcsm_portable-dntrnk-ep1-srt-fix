1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You feeling any better, Gabriel?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,225
Better is relative. The battle with the Witherstorm sapped

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,000
the last of my strength. Considerable though it was.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You need to rest.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're right, I do.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,142
Look, Jesse, wherever you guys go next, give him some time

7
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:24,000
to get his strength back.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The problem is we don't have time.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,900
Jesse's right. In fact, it might be best if my journey ends

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,000
here. This cave is safe, easy to defend.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,866
If that's what you feel is best, then I support it. You've

12
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,000
been through too much as it is.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,682
Thank you, Jesse. I'm just sorry that I can't be there for

14
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:46,000
you.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Me too.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,333
Nothing had to turn out like this. If the order had just

17
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:59,952
been different, if we'd made smarter choices, Iver wouldn't

18
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:05,285
have turned into a maniac and, well, maybe Elagard would

19
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:07,000
still be alive.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Come on, let's not talk about the old days.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,080
But how can we not? So many lives torn asunder, the world

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
ripped to pieces.
