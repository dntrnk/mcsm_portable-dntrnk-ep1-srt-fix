00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You feeling any better, Gabriel?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Better is relative. The battle with the Witherstorm sapped the last of my strength. Considerable though it was.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You need to rest.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're right, I do.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Look, Jesse, wherever you guys go next, give him some time to get his strength back.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The problem is we don't have time.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Jesse's right. In fact, it might be best if my journey ends here. This cave is safe, easy to defend.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If that's what you feel is best, then I support it. You've been through too much as it is.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you, Jesse. I'm just sorry that I can't be there for you.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Me too.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nothing had to turn out like this. If the order had just been different, if we'd made smarter choices, Iver wouldn't have turned into a maniac and, well, maybe Elagard would still be alive.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Come on, let's not talk about the old days.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But how can we not? So many lives torn asunder, the world ripped to pieces.
