1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We need to find a way for me to use this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,621
Whoa, that is, without question, the coolest thing I have

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,000
ever, ever seen.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, me too! Nice, Jesse!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Petra, you saw that back at the Far Lands.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's still cool.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, and I brought you some armor, Axle.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Nice! I was feeling a little left out.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Does anyone see the command block?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't see it.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't see it.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't see it.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't see it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't see it.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Does anyone see the command block?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't think it's exposed.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We need to get more Endermen focused on the Winter Storm.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,555
How do you make Endermen focus? I can't even make myself

21
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:11,000
focus.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,462
Wait, we shouldn't be here. Not if this is going according

23
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,000
to plan.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Zorin? What are you doing?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I, uh, you know, I've really enjoyed meeting you all, but...

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Zorin!

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Did Zorin just run away?
