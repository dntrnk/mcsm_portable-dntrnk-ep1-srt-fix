1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We need to find a way for me to use this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,621
Whoa, that is, without question, the coolest thing I have

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,000
ever, ever seen.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, me too! Nice, Jesse!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Petra, you saw that back at the Far Lands.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's still cool.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, and I brought you some armor, Axel.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Nice! I was feeling a little left out.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Woohoo!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Does anyone see the command block?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Does anyone see the command block?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't think it's exposed.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We need to get more Endermen focused on the Winter Storm.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,555
How do you make Endermen focus? I can't even make myself

17
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:10,000
focus.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,470
Wait, we shouldn't be here. None of this is going according

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,000
to plan.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sorry? What are you doing?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I, uh, you know, I've really enjoyed meeting you all, but...

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Soren!

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Did Soren just run away?
