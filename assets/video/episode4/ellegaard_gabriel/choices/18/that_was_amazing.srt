1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That was absolutely amazing!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,000
They didn't call us the Order of the Stone for nothing.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,300
I wonder if that story will help me solve this puzzle.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,000
Bow and arrow, great weapons.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's a sword. So Soren rode the dragon, huh?

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Hey Ruben, give me a boost, will ya?

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Aha!

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Yes!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, that's it!

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then Gabriel poked it dead with a sword.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Bravo! You did it!

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's the book.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Wait, aren't those the Ender crystals?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Like the real ones?

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
No, it can't be.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But those things were destroyed in your big heroic battle with the Ender dragon, right, Soren?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He kept them. The fool actually kept them.

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Soren, you said destroying these crystals was the key to defeating the Ender dragon.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You did kill the Ender dragon, right?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Jesse, this isn't... this isn't what it looks like. Our story, the story, it's mostly true. I swear, I swear.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Soren, I want the truth and I want it now.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't. We swore never to speak of it.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't care.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm afraid I haven't been honest with you, Jesse. We did defeat the Ender dragon, but it wasn't exactly like I said.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How not exactly?

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We got rid of it, but we didn't kill it per se.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So what did you do to it?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We didn't do anything. We used the command block.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You used the command block to defeat the Ender dragon?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm afraid so.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Understand, when I found that blasted block, we were nobodies.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But with its help, we became stronger, faster. We could do so much more.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The others had no idea what I was doing. Yet the more I used it, the more we came to depend on it.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I knew it was only so long before someone would find out.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I concocted a plan.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I would use the command block to blink the Ender dragon out of existence.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Securing our status as legends forever.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We told the world we defeated a dragon. And the rest is history.
