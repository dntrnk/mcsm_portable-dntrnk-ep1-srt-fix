1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yes, at Endercon.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, Endercon is a chicken convention?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Uh, no?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I would love to go to a chicken convention.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wait, it's already fading. Fading and... gone.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,112
Take my advice, Petra. Some stories are better left

7
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:24,000
forgotten.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That was amazing. Isn't it amazing?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go see what he's hiding in there.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How can one person need this many books?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We should be careful. This place could be booby-trapped.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's just start looking for the enchanting book.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sure there's a way to get there.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sure there's a way to get there.
