1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,488
Well, for starters, we're the ones who brought them back

2
00:00:02,488 --> 00:00:03,200
together again.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,200
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,900
Wait a second. I think I see what he was trying to do.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Jesse, take this piston, craft it into a sticky piston,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,378
then place it on the other side of the barge, along with a

7
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,200
redstone block.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,200
You got all that?

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
I think so.
