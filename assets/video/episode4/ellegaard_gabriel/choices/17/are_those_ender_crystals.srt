1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
And these are supposed to be the Ender crystals?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,240
Scale models of them. They were the secret to the dragon's demise.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
The secret, huh?

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,000
Ha, if only you'd been there. It was a fight for the ages.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,760
We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
But even so, the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had imagined.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,360
I realized that it was drawing strength from the Ender crystals,

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,360
and that the crystals had to be destroyed.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,960
I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow,

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,960
the second I destroyed by launching myself on the shockwave of Magnus' TNT.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Using only my strength and my wiles,

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,560
I steered the foul beast toward the third crystal.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,560
I flew the dragon directly toward the final crystal.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
We became heroes, and eventually, legends.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
The greatest the world has ever known.
