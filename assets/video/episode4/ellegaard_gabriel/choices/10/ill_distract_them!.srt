1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We need to distract them! Get out of here!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Fine, but how?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The rest of you go!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll hold them off!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What? Ivor, no!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's no time to argue. Just head for the corner of the glitch wall!

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The what wall?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey you, witch! You're not the only one who can draw a potion!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Come on!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You lost them for wow?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is that?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh...

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome to the Far Lands.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm Ivor.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm Ivor.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'd rather be hungry than boiling in some cauldron.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'd rather be eating dinner.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Quite a sight, isn't it?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sorin, have you been here before?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How can Ivor live here?

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End, but this...

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whatever Ivor's hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not sure I've seen this before.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I suspect it's this way.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'd feel better about this if Axel and Lucas were here.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not sure I've seen this before.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on!

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is this... a maze?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It would appear so.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A massive one from the looks of it.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold unspeakable peril.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There has to be another way.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A secret door, or... I don't know.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Somewhere around.
