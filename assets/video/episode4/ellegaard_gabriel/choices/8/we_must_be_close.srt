1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
We must be there now, right?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,200
No.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,400
No, we're not even close!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
My butt's never been so sore in my life.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,600
Not that I'd remember.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Feels like we've been riding forever.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,200
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,675
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of

9
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:30,500
our comprehension.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Oh, please.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,700
The Far Lands are a happy accident.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
Nature's way of keeping life interesting.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,600
No, no, no. They are perilous and unpredictable.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,900
Hold on, back up.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
What exactly are the Far Lands?

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Are you being serious?

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,500
The Far Lands lie at the very edge of all things,

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,200
where logic gives way to chaos.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,200
They're a dangerous place to visit,

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
and a ridiculous place to construct a laboratory.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,700
Just wait until you see it.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Do those two never stop arguing?

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
You asking me?

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,800
All I can think about is food.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,700
No kidding. I'm starving.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,900
Maybe we should turn back?

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,300
This isn't the time. Swamps are too dangerous.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,400
Guys, we can't turn back now, not after coming so far.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,600
So am I.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
We mustn't linger long.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
The Far Lands are just beyond this swamp.

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,100
So this could be our last chance to find food?

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
I'll be back.

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
A witch is out.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
We should steer clear of it.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,000
Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,300
Look, a cake! That's enough to feed everyone.

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,000
It isn't worth it, Jesse.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Witches hate trespassers.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Is that a witch?

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,900
Jesse, we shouldn't be here.

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,900
Witches are very strong.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,000
And they know these swamps far better than I.
