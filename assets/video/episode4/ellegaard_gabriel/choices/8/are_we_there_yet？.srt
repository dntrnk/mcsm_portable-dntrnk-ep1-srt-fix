1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Are we there yet? No, no, no, we are not there yet.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,840
My butt's never been so sore in my life.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,540
Not that I remember.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,220
Feels like we've been riding forever.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,260
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,560
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of our comprehension.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,760
Oh, please. The Far Lands are a happy accident.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,060
Nature's way of keeping life interesting.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,760
No, no, no. They are perilous and unpredictable.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,900
Hold on, back up. What exactly are the Far Lands?

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,200
Are you being serious?

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,240
The Far Lands lie at the very edge of all things, where logic gives way to chaos.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,520
They're a dangerous place to visit, and a ridiculous place to construct a laboratory.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,720
Just wait until you see it.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
Do those two never stop arguing?

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,980
You asking me? All I can think about is food.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,060
No kidding. I'm starving. Maybe we should turn back?

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,400
This isn't the time. Swamps are too dangerous.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
Guys, we can't turn back now, not after coming so far.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,840
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
So am I.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,280
We mustn't linger long. The Far Lands are just beyond this swamp.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,740
So this could be our last chance to find food?

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
I'll be back.

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,400
A witch is out. We should steer clear of it.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,640
Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved.

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,860
Look, a cake! That's enough to feed everyone.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,900
It isn't worth it, Jesse. Witches hate trespassers.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Is that a witch?

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Jesse, we shouldn't be here. Witches are very strong.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
And they know these swamps far better than I.
