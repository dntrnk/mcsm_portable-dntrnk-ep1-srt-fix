00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Okay, a redstone block.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:30,440
Okay, let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to go and place these pistons.

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,000
Holy cow, we did it!

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm proud of you, Olivia.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Thanks, Jesse.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,760
And thanks for everything you said just before.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
It really helped.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
No problemo.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,560
This way, this way!

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Run!

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Everybody get on!

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Quick, onto the barge!

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,560
That was close.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Everyone okay?

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,560
For the moment.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Slime!

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm remembering something with slime and chickens.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Or maybe they were ducks?

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
There was a big gathering of people.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,560
And we were looking for a man with a sword.
