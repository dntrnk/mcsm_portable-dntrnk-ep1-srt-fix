00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
Okay, a redstone block.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Okay, let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to go and place these pistons.

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Holy cow, we did it!

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm proud of you, Olivia.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Thanks, Jesse. And thanks for everything you said just before. It really helped.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
No problemo.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:59,800
This way! This way! Run!

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Everybody get on! Quick, onto the barge!

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:14,800
That was close. Everyone okay?

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
For the moment.

11
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Slime! I'm remembering something with slime and chickens.

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Or maybe they were ducks? There was a big gathering of people.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,800
And we were looking for a man with a sword.
