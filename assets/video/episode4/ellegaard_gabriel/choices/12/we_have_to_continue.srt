1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Well, we've got to push on to Ivor's lab somehow.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,400
Too bad there's a gaping bottomless pit in the way.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,200
What about this thing? Could it get us across?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's some kind of flying barge.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,800
It would probably get us to the other side.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,400
But it's in really bad shape.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
And it's really complicated.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
You can fix it though, right?

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
I don't know.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
I think it's out of my league.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Come on, you'll figure it out. You know you always do.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,400
This layout doesn't even make any sense.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
What was Ivor thinking?

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Or maybe it's just me.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,097
I mean, Ellegard herself said I don't have what it takes to

16
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,200
be a great engineer.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
So prove her wrong. Show the world what you're made of.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Prove her wrong?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Jesse, she was the greatest redstone engineer ever.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
She was in the Order of the Stone.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Sure, but the Order are still people, just like us.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Right. Just like us.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,470
I mean, how are we the ones saving the world when even they

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,000
don't have what it takes?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,800
Soren and Ivor are always at each other's throats.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,533
All I ever see Magnus do is argue, and we both know what

27
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,000
happened to Ellegard.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If the Order can't do this, how are we supposed to?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All I know is the world is depending on us.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then maybe the world is in trouble.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean, they defeated an Ender Dragon.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Can you name even one thing we've done right?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I don't mean managing to stay alive.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Something that actually matters.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Something that actually matters.
