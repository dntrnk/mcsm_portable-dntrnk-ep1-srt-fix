1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And how is that any better? You reveal their lies at the expense of the world itself?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Look, my wither plan obviously backfired.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You think?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I didn't know we'd end up with three of those things tearing the world apart!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Which brings us back to why we're here. We need to destroy that command block. Like now!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Jesse's right. Destroying the command block is all that matters anymore.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How ironic that the best thing the command block gave us was the very means to destroy it.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So the enchanting book, what do we do with it?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You craft a weapon, then put it on an anvil. Follow me, I'll show you.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Ivor? I'm sorry. About everything.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, well, it doesn't matter now.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Grab some ingredients and craft a weapon. I'll show you how to enchant it.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sweet.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's see, there's a bunch of crafting stuff and...

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Diamond score!

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you for watching!
