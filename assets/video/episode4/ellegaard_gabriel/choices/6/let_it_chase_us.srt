00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The Witherstorms are already chasing us. If we just get them to chase us to your fortress again...

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,400
They'll be caught between a rock and a hard place!

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,040
Ugh, yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not even a Formita bomb.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,120
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
What kind of failsafe, exactly?

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,400
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the command block itself.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,880
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits. Forever!

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,880
Yes. Yes, that's it!

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:54,400
Ivor! It is you!

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,800
Good to see you too, Magnus.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,360
It just keeps coming for us.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,640
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,520
Ivor says it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,480
The point is, we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,360
I'll take it. I'll keep the wither storms busy. You guys do what you gotta do.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,720
Axel, thank you.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,040
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at Soren's fortress.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with you, man.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,100
Nice.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,440
Well, I wanna go with Jesse. That feels like where I belong.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,920
Everyone, take good care of yourselves.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,760
Hey, Jesse, let's try our handshake again, just once for the road.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,720
you
