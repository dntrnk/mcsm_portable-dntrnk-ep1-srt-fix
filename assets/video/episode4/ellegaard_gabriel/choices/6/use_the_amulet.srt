1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
We know for a fact the wither storm will follow the ambulance. So if we take the amulet back to your fortress where the endermen are

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,680
We'll lead them straight into a massive trap. Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,240
Yes

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,480
It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,120
Not even a formidable. Yes. Well, I created a fail safe. What kind of fail safe exactly?

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
an enchanting book

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
One that contains the power of the command block itself

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
Use it to enchant a weapon and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
forever

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,400
Yes

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Yes, that's it

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
I

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,240
Vore it is you good to see you too magnus

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
It just keeps coming for us

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,800
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says it's because of the amulet that gabriel

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,640
The point is we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet. I'll take it

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,840
I'll keep the wither storms busy. You guys do what you got to do axel. Thank you. You just go make that super weapon

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
I'll meet you back at soren's fortress

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
Well axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with you, man

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
nice

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Well, I want to go with jesse

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
That feels like where I belong

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Everyone take good care of yourselves

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:44,020
Hey jesse, let's try our handshake again just once for the road
