1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,596
We know for a fact the wither storm will follow the

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:05,498
ambulance. So if we take the amulet back to your fortress

3
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:06,720
where the endermen are

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,532
We'll lead them straight into a massive trap. Just one

5
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:13,680
problem. You're forgetting about the command block

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,240
Yes

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,480
It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,996
Not even a formidable. Yes. Well, I created a fail safe.

9
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,120
What kind of fail safe exactly?

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
an enchanting book

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
One that contains the power of the command block itself

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,684
Use it to enchant a weapon and you'll be able to smash the

13
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:36,960
command block to bits

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
forever

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,400
Yes

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Yes, that's it

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
I

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,240
Vore it is you good to see you too magnus

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
It just keeps coming for us

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,766
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says

21
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,800
it's because of the amulet that gabriel

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,187
The point is we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as

23
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:12,640
long as we have that amulet. I'll take it

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,360
I'll keep the wither storms busy. You guys do what you got

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,840
to do axel. Thank you. You just go make that super weapon

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
I'll meet you back at soren's fortress

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,868
Well axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with

28
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:26,320
you, man

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
nice

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Well, I want to go with jesse

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
That feels like where I belong

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Everyone take good care of yourselves

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,446
Hey jesse, let's try our handshake again just once for the

34
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:44,020
road
