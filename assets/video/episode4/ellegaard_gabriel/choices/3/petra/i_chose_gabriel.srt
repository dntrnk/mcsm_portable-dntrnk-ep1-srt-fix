1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Look, there were two of you caught in the tractor beam that day and...

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,700
Well, I helped Gabriel.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
The sick guy over there.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh...

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Yeah, I think I do remember that.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,800
You gotta realize I thought we needed him if it was just about who I liked.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,500
No, I get it.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,500
You did what you had to do.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,200
All that matters is you're with us now.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,000
And that you're still a fighter.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
The best one I know.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,300
So, what do you say? Will you be part of our group again?

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,800
Alright. Count me in.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
We didn't all make it back, though.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Guys, it was my fault.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
I'm the one who took Eligard's armor.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,800
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,800
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I, uh, never blame myself for anything.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,800
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
What I want to know is what happened out there today.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,800
Why is that thing still alive?

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,300
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
So the command block is still out there?

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,800
Oh, great.

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
The question is, what do we do?

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Why are you asking me?

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I need a moment to think.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,300
Is he always like this?

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
You have no idea.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
That jacket, it looks familiar.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Lucas always wears that jacket.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown from that dead monster.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Even thinking about it hurts.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Hey, hey, it's okay.

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I mean, do you think?

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,800
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the witherstorm...
