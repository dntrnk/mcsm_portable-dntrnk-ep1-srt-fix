1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Doesn't matter how this started or who started it. We just have to end it.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
You're right. I know you're right. I only wish I could continue to help.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,680
It was dark and foul and I was sure I was a goner.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,040
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive, which is more than I can say for some of us.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,360
Oh man, Ellie. For a second I almost managed to forget.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,840
Are you guys talking about Ellegard?

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,680
I just can't believe she's gone. It doesn't feel real.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Ellegard's armor.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,880
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,200
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid. I never blame myself for anything.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
Ah! Being emotional is getting us nowhere.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,720
What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why is that thing still alive?

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,840
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,120
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,720
So the command block is still out there? Oh, great.

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
The question is, what do we do?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,480
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
I need a moment to think.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
Is he always like this?

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,880
You have no idea.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
That jacket, it looks familiar.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
Lucas always wears that jacket.

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,080
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown from that dead monster.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,520
Even thinking about it hurts.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,800
Hey, hey, it's okay.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,560
Jesse, if what Petra said is true... I mean, do you think?

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the witherstorm...
