1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Why would you do that? You... you lied, even to your closest friends!

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,900
All I can say is...

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,800
I was a fool.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,700
So you finally admit it.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,400
Soren, how could you?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,700
Ivor...

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,900
How long have you guys been standing there?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,100
Long enough that they heard the whole thing!

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,700
You lied to the whole world?

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,900
You didn't think you could keep it secret forever, did you, Soren?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,900
Is this why you left the Order? Because Soren lied?

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Because they all did!

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,600
Soren, Gabriel, Magnus, Eligard...

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,900
They agreed to keep this a secret.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,800
And you... you agreed to stay quiet too, in exchange for all of our treasures.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,000
I've technically never told anybody.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,200
So this whole thing, the wither you unleashed, it's all been to teach the Order a lesson?

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,200
To teach the world a lesson!

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,300
To show you who the Order really are!

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,000
Liars, cowards!

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,400
And now, they know!

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Yes...

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,200
I suppose they do.
