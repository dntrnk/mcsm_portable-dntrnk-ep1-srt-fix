1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope that they could fix things, but...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I guess I should have known better.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, you want help, do you?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's what I said, isn't it? Just as you once helped us before.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This isn't about the past, it's about the future.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are three of those things now.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You say that like it's my fault!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll take responsibility for once, Soren.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Soren, you need to listen to me.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hush, Ivor, for once!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What you don't understand is, you are all in very grave danger.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously!

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I mean specifically this group.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Witherstorm isn't acting randomly. It's following Gabriel.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What? Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following Jesse!

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I... I didn't know.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those things!

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nothing even hurts them!

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, except Enderman.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We actually just saw a bunch of Enderman pull blocks off a Witherstorm.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, enough of them working together might be able to destroy a Witherstorm entirely.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Enderman together?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Enderman aren't pets. They don't follow orders.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thanks for watching!
