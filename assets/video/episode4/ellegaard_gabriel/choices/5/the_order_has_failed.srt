1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,666
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,000
that they could fix things, but...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I guess I should have known better.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, you want help, do you?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,375
That's what I said, isn't it? Just as you once helped us

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,000
before.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This isn't about the past, it's about the future.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are three of those things now.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You say that like it's my fault!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll take responsibility for once, Soren.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Soren, you need to listen to me.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hush, Ivor, for once!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,515
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

16
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:37,000
reason.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,492
What you don't understand is, you are all in very grave

18
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:41,000
danger.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously!

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I mean specifically this group.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,274
The Witherstorm isn't acting randomly. It's following

22
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:51,000
Gabriel.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,785
What? Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's

26
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:06,000
following Jesse!

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I... I didn't know.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,483
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those

30
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:13,000
things!

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nothing even hurts them!

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, except Enderman.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,267
We actually just saw a bunch of Enderman pull blocks off a

34
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:22,000
Witherstorm.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,714
So, enough of them working together might be able to

36
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:28,000
destroy a Witherstorm entirely.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,402
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Enderman

38
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:33,000
together?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Enderman aren't pets. They don't follow orders.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thanks for watching!
