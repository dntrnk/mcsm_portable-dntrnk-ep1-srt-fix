1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We need to distract them! Get out of here!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Fine! But how?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The rest of you, go!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll hold them off!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What? Ivor, no!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's no time to argue. Just head for the corner of the glitch wall!

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The what wall?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey you, witch! You're not the only one who can throw a potion!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Come on!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You lost them for wow?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is that?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh...

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wow!

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome to the Far Land.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'd rather be hungry than killed by a witch.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd rather be eating dinner.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Quite a sight, isn't it?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sauron, have you been here before?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How can Ivor live here? I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End, but this...

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Whatever Ivor's hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This way, I suspect.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'd feel better about this if the rest of our group was with us.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come on!

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is this... a maze?

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It would appear so.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A massive one from the looks of it.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it would hold unspeakable peril.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why do I sense that entering this so-called maze would be a good idea?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not sure.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not sure.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not sure.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not sure.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not sure.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Entering the so-called maze would be a grave mistake.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Fortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There has to be another way.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A secret door, or, I don't know...

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
some way around.
