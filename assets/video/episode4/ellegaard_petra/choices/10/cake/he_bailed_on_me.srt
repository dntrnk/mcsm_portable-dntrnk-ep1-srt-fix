1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man!

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Come on!

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,360
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Wow!

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,320
What is that?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Oh...

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Wow!

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,480
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,880
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
Say what you like about witches.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
They sure know how to make a cake.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,760
Quite a sight, isn't it?

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,880
Swarn, have you been here before?

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,800
How can Ivor live here?

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,680
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End,

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
but this...

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,932
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

26
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:33,440
research.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,134
Whatever Ivor's hiding in here, it will be extremely well

28
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:37,680
guarded.

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
This way, I suspect.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,298
I'd feel better about this if the rest of our group was

31
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:49,720
with us.

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Come on!

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Is this... a maze?

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,480
It would appear so.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
A massive one from the looks of it.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,462
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold

37
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,680
unspeakable peril.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Why do I sense that interest in the Far Lands?

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm sure it's because of the way Ivor's been working.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm sure he's been working on this for a long time.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I think Ivor's been working on this for a long time.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
I think Ivor's been working on this for a long time.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,463
Why do I sense that entering this so-called maze would be a

44
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,680
grave mistake?

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
There has to be another way.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
A secret door, or... I don't know.

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Some way around.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm sure Ivor's been working on this for a long time.
