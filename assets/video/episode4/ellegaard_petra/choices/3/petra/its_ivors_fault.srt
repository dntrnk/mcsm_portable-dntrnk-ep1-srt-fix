1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
This isn't your fault. It's Ivor's who wouldn't do something stupid for a diamond

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,080
But without my help Ivor wouldn't have wouldn't have wanted revenge on Gabriel

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,580
Believe me. He would have found another way. I'm gonna do everything I can to make this right

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,720
Petra I know this isn't easy to hear but you're too sick to be going anywhere. I'm not that sick

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,780
Maybe you should rest in this cave for a while. I mean it's safe

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,000
Defensible if I say I'm fine, then I'm

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,160
Fine

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
You staying here is the right move

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,700
You'll never get better if we keep pushing you but I want to be there for you guys. I know you do and you will

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,040
Maybe you're right. It's the right call Jesse. I hope so. We didn't all make it back though

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Guys it was my fault

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm the one who took elegant armor

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,160
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,580
She's right. Don't blame yourself kid. Hi. Yeah, never blame myself for anything

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Being emotional is getting us nowhere

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,080
What I want to know is what happened out there today? Why is that thing still alive?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,600
The formidable just wasn't strong enough. I mean it ripped the wither storm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,720
So the command block is still out there. Oh

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,840
Great

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,860
Look our plan didn't work. So we obviously need a new one

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,240
Question is what do we do?

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,000
Why are you asking me am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Huh? I need a moment to think

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,440
Is he always like this? Do you have no idea?

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,500
That jacket I recognize it

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,600
Lucas always wears that jacket. No, there were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,860
It hurts just to think about hey, it's okay

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Hey

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,580
Jesse if what Gabriel said is true, I

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,060
Mean do you think I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just tracked in the wither storm
