00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You can thank me by watching out for me and my friends. This fight isn't over yet.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Very well.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive, which is more than I can say for some of us.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh man, Ellie. For a second I almost managed to forget.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you guys talking about Ellegard?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I just can't believe she's gone. Doesn't feel real.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Ellegard's armor.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She's right. Don't blame yourself, kid. I, uh, never blame myself for anything.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Being emotional is getting us nowhere. What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why is that thing still alive?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough. I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So the command block is still out there? Oh, great.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one. Question is, what do we do?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I need a moment to think.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is he always like this?

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You have no idea.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That jacket! I recognize it!

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Lucas always wears that jacket.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It hurts just to think about.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hey, hey, it's okay.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I mean, do you think? I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the witherstorm...
