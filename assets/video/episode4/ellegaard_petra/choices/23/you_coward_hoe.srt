1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Soren, you coward, I can't believe you!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
I can.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Jesse, you can handle things out here, right?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800
What?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,000
I can't let him get himself killed!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Just get to the command block and destroy it!

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
Soren!

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,400
So much for the mighty Order of the Stone.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Doesn't matter. We have work to do.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
We need to get those Endermen to attack it!

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Jesse, that's it!

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Make them chase you into the tractor beam!

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,800
How do you like that? Purple-eyed freak?

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,800
How do you like that? Purple-eyed freak?

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Yes, they're falling for it!

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Jesse, look! It's working!

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
That hole's big enough to get inside of.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Now we just need to find you a way up.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Or build you a way up.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
That's it!

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Everyone, empty your pockets!

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Let's see...

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Iowar's army.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I've got pistons, repeaters, some wool,

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
some leftover wood, and some wood for the fire.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Frontiers, some wool, some leftover slime...

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Oh, and I still have that minecart!

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
That's gotta be enough to make something, right?

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say..

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
That minecart!

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Or those pistons.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
And we do have all that cobblestone!

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Maybe we could build a ramp!

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Or even go straight up vertically!

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Or find a way to use redstone!

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
We're close to an answer! I can feel it!
