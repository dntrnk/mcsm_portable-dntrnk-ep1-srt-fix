00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
Soren come back here dude, what a chicken

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,939
Jesse you can handle things out here, right? What I can't

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,720
let him get himself killed

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,160
Just get to the command block and destroy it. Sorry

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,080
So much for the mighty order of the stone

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,760
It doesn't matter. We have work to do

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,880
We need to get those Enderman to attack it

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Be Jesse that's it

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
hehe

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, they're falling for it.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Jesse, look!

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's working!

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That hole's big enough to get inside of.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now we just need to find you a way up.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Or build you a way up.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's it!

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Everyone, empty your pockets!

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's see...

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've got redstone and cobblestone from IWARS Armory.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've got pistons, repeaters, some wool, some leftover slime.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, and I still have that minecart.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's gotta be enough to make something, right?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or those pistons.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And we do have all that cobblestone.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Maybe we could build a ramp?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Or even go straight up vertically.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Or find a way to use redstone.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're close to an answer. I can feel it!
