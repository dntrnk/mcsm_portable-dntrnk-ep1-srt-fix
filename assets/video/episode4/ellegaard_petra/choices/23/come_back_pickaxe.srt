1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
Soren come back here dude, what a chicken

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,939
Jesse you can handle things out here, right? What I can't

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,720
let him get himself killed

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,160
Just get to the command block and destroy it. Sorry

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,080
So much for the mighty order of the stone

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,760
It doesn't matter. We have work to do

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,880
We need to get those Enderman to attack it

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Be Jesse that's it

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,100
epoxy

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Yes, they're falling for it.

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,100
Jesse, look!

12
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,100
It's working!

13
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,100
That hose big enough to get inside of.

14
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Now we just need to find you a way up.

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Or build you a way up.

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,100
That's it!

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
Everyone, empty your pockets!

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's see...

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Iowars Armory.

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:47,180
I've got pistons, repeaters, some wool, and some

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,180
Oh, and I still have that minecart.

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
That's got to be enough to make something, right?

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,180
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,180
The minecart?

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
Or those pistons.

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,180
And we do have all that cobblestone.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,180
Maybe we could build a ramp?

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
Or even go straight up vertically.

30
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
Or find a way to use redstone.

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
We're close to an answer.

32
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
I can feel it!
