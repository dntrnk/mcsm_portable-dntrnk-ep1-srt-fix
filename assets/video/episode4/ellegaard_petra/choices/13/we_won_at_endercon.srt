00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, we won that building contest at Endercon.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That was a contest, Jesse.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Right, and the competition was stiff.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just think what we can do when there's nobody even watching.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like that way of looking at it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Wait a second. I think I see what he was trying to do.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Jesse, take this piston, craft it into a sticky piston, then place it on the other side of the barge, along with a redstone block.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You got all that?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I think so.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thanks for watching!
