1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,844
We followed Ivor to the Far Lands. We might as well keep

2
00:00:02,844 --> 00:00:03,200
going.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Here we go. Into another dungeon of doom.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Whoa. A stone waterfall?

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,200
That's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,095
The Far Lands may be perilous, but they are indisputably

7
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:36,000
fascinating.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
We should probably keep moving.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,400
Guys, looks like this is a...

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,200
There's too many! We can't light them all!

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
Everyone, back!

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Ugh!

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Who needs to climb when you have a potion of leaping?

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Guys, carve the vines!

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,800
Well, that worked, I suppose.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,400
Yeah, I guess.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
But now what do we do? We're all separated.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,246
Let's just head that way and find a place where the pads

19
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:27,800
connect.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Sure hope they don't get lost in there.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I hope I don't get lost in there.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Sigh.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Hey, that must be Ivor's lab.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Wish it was a little closer.

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Huh. What's that?

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Looks like Ivor kept some redstone dust handy.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
And a slime ball.

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Huh. Redstone blocks. Some pistons.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
I wonder what this thing's supposed to be.

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Hello? Anyone?

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Olivia! Is that you?

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Jesse! There you are.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
This maze? We don't have time for this.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Who even knows where the others are by now?

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
I mean, the clock's ticking here, Jesse.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Yet we're lost in some elaborate puzzle.

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Thanks for watching!
