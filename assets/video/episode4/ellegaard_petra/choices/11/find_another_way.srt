1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,116
There's no way we're going into some crazy maze that I were

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:06,000
built to keep people away.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We'll find some other way through.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Best decision you've made all day.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Huh. We can probably climb these.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Everyone, on guard!

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's too many! We can't fight them all!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Who needs to climb when you have a potion of leaping?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Guys, climb the vines!

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, that worked, I suppose.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, I guess.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But now what do we do? We're all separated.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,454
Let's just head that way and find a place where the paths

14
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:05,000
connect.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sure hope they don't get lost in there.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I hope I don't get lost in there.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, that must be Ivor's lab.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Wish it was a little closer.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's that?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Looks like Ivor kept some redstone dust handy.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And a slime ball.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Redstone blocks, some pistons.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wonder what this thing's supposed to be.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello? Anyone?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Olivia, is that you?

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jesse, there you are.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This maze? We don't have time for this.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Who even knows where the others are by now?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I mean, the clock's ticking here, Jesse.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yet we're lost in some elaborate puzzle.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yet we're lost in some elaborate puzzle.
