1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, at least we're back together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes! The dream team reunited!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now the dream team's just got to find a way across this gaping bottomless pit.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What about this thing? Could it get us across?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's some kind of flying barge. It would probably get us to the other side.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But it's in really bad shape. And it's really complicated.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can fix it though, right?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know. I think it's out of my league.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come on, you'll figure it out. You know you always do.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This layout doesn't even make any sense. What was I ever thinking?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or maybe it's just me. I mean, Ellegard herself said I don't have what it takes to be a great engineer.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So prove her wrong. Show the world what you're made of.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Prove her wrong? Jesse, she was the greatest redstone engineer ever.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She was in the Order of the Stone.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sure, but the Order are still people, just like us.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Right. Just like us. I mean, how are we the ones saving the world when even they don't have what it takes?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Soren and Ivor are always at each other's throats. All I ever see Magnus do is argue.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And we both know what happened to Ellegard.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If the Order can't do this, how are we supposed to?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All I know is the world is depending on us.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then maybe the world is in trouble. I mean, they defeated an Ender Dragon.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can you name even one thing we've done right?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I don't mean managing to stay alive.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Something that actually matters.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I mean, it's not something that really matters.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's something that really matters.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's something that really matters.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's something that really matters.
