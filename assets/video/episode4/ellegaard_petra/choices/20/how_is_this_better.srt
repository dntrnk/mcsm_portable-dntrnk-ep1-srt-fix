1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
And how is that any better? You reveal their lies at the

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,600
expense of the world itself?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,520
Look, my wither plan obviously backfired.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,040
You think?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,065
I didn't know we'd end up with three of those things

6
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,520
tearing the world apart!

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,316
Which brings us back to why we're here. We need to destroy

8
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,280
that command block. Like now!

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,335
Jesse's right. Destroying the command block is all that

10
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:25,280
matters anymore.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,805
How ironic that the best thing the command block gave us

12
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:34,160
was the very means to destroy it.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
So the enchanting book, what do we do with it?

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,228
You craft a weapon, then put it on an anvil. Follow me,

15
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:42,480
I'll show you.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,280
Ivor? I'm sorry. About everything.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,280
Yes, well, it doesn't matter now.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,283
Grab some ingredients and craft a weapon. I'll show you how

19
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:00,240
to enchant it.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,720
Sweet.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,080
Let's see, there's a bunch of crafting stuff and...

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Diamond score!
