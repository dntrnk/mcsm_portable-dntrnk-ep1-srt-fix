1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
And how is that any better? You reveal their lies at the expense of the world itself?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,520
Look, my wither plan obviously backfired.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,040
You think?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,520
I didn't know we'd end up with three of those things tearing the world apart!

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,280
Which brings us back to why we're here. We need to destroy that command block. Like now!

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Jesse's right. Destroying the command block is all that matters anymore.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:34,160
How ironic that the best thing the command block gave us was the very means to destroy it.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
So the enchanting book, what do we do with it?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,480
You craft a weapon, then put it on an anvil. Follow me, I'll show you.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,280
Ivor? I'm sorry. About everything.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,280
Yes, well, it doesn't matter now.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,240
Grab some ingredients and craft a weapon. I'll show you how to enchant it.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,720
Sweet.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,080
Let's see, there's a bunch of crafting stuff and...

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Diamond score!
