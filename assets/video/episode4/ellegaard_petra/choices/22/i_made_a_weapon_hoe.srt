1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We need to find a way for me to use this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Whoa, that is, without question, the coolest thing I have ever, ever seen.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, and I brought you some armor, Axel.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nice! I was feeling a little left out.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Woohoo!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Does anyone see the command block?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't think it's exposed!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We need to get out of here!

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to get out of here!

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm going to get out of here!

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm going to get out of here!

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm going to get out of here!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Command block?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't think it's exposed!

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We need to get more Endermen focused on the Winter Store!

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How do you make Endermen focus? I can't even make myself focus.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We shouldn't be here. None of this is going according to plan.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Zorin? What are you doing?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I, uh, you know, I really enjoy meeting you all, but...

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Zorin!

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Did Zorin just run away?
