00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The Witherstorms are already chasing us. If we just get them to chase us to your fortress again...

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,200
They'll be caught between a rock and a hard place!

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,000
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Ugh, yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not even a Formita bomb.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What kind of failsafe, exactly?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the command block itself.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits. Forever!

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes. Yes, that's it!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ivor!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is you!

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good to see you too, Magnus.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It just keeps coming for us.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll take it. I'll keep the Witherstorms busy. You guys do what you gotta do.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Axel, thank you.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at Soren's fortress.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with you, man.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Nice.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, I'm going with Jesse. I pledge to help, and that's what I must do.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everyone, take good care of yourselves.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey, Jesse. Let's try our handshake again, just once for the road.
