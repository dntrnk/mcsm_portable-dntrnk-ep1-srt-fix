1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,918
The Witherstorms are already chasing us. If we just get

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:05,200
them to chase us to your fortress again...

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,200
They'll be caught between a rock and a hard place!

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,000
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,162
Ugh, yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not

6
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,000
even a Formita bomb.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What kind of failsafe, exactly?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,263
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the

10
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:30,000
command block itself.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,538
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the

12
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:37,000
command block to bits. Forever!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes. Yes, that's it!

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ivor!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is you!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good to see you too, Magnus.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It just keeps coming for us.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,393
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says

20
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:06,000
it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,766
I'll take it. I'll keep the Witherstorms busy. You guys do

23
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:15,000
what you gotta do.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Axel, thank you.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,000
Soren's fortress.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,420
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,000
you, man.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Nice.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,888
Well, I'm going with Jesse. I pledge to help, and that's

31
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:32,000
what I must do.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everyone, take good care of yourselves.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,090
Hey, Jesse. Let's try our handshake again, just once for

34
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,000
the road.
