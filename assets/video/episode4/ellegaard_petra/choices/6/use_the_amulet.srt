1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,575
We know for a fact that wither storm will follow the

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:03,120
ambulance.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,293
So if we take the amulet back to your fortress where the

4
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:07,200
endermen are...

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,080
We'll lead them straight into a massive trap!

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,680
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,005
Ugh, yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not

8
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,720
even a formidable.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,280
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,200
What kind of failsafe exactly?

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,513
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the

12
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,320
command block itself.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,158
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the

14
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,240
command block to bits. Forever!

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
Yes. Yes, that's it!

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
What?

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Ivor! It is you!

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
Good to see you too, Magnus.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,200
It just keeps coming for us.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,503
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says

21
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:07,040
it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,293
The point is we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as

23
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,920
long as we have that amulet.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,611
I'll take it. I'll keep the wither storms busy. You guys do

25
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:16,800
what you gotta do.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
Axel, thank you.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,888
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at

28
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:23,040
Soren's fortress.

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,460
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,040
you, man.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,080
Nice.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,844
Well, I'm going with Jesse. I pledge to help, and that's

33
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,000
what I must do.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
Everyone take good care of yourselves.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,013
Hey, Jesse. Let's try our handshake again, just once for

36
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:44,080
the road.
