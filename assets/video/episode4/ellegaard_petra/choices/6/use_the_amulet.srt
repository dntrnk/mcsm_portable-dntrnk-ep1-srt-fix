1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
We know for a fact that wither storm will follow the ambulance.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
So if we take the amulet back to your fortress where the endermen are...

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,080
We'll lead them straight into a massive trap!

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,680
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,720
Ugh, yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not even a formidable.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,280
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,200
What kind of failsafe exactly?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,320
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the command block itself.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,240
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits. Forever!

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
Yes. Yes, that's it!

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
What?

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Ivor! It is you!

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
Good to see you too, Magnus.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,200
It just keeps coming for us.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,920
The point is we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,800
I'll take it. I'll keep the wither storms busy. You guys do what you gotta do.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
Axel, thank you.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,040
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at Soren's fortress.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm coming with you, man.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,080
Nice.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, I'm going with Jesse. I pledge to help, and that's what I must do.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
Everyone take good care of yourselves.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,080
Hey, Jesse. Let's try our handshake again, just once for the road.
