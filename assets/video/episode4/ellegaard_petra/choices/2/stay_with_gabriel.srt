1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,133
I'm not gonna lie man, but we've pulled through worse,

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:03,540
right?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,860
Have we?

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,620
How's it going?

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,340
Tell me Jesse who is this person?

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,020
He keeps insulting me

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,820
That right there is Magnus. Everyone knows Magnus

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,780
Magnus

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,736
How do I know him exactly you guys defeated the Ender

10
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,648
dragon together the most fearsome creature this land has

11
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:26,220
ever seen

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,440
Really?

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,120
Really? You're kind of a big deal. It isn't working

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,165
He doesn't remember talk to him about your past something

15
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:36,500
only you would know about

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,060
Like what talk about fighting the Ender dragon. No, no, no,

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,680
no anything but that. Come on. It's what you're famous for

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,520
Well, all right then

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,840
the Ender dragon you see it was huge and dangerous and

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,523
And for a while there it looked like we were goners, but

21
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,500
you know who stepped in and killed that thing

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,860
Was it Jesse? Huh? No, it was you man. You killed it. Oh

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,516
Thank you for sharing that with me and Jesse. Thank you,

24
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:15,860

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,660
I need to repay your kindness

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,140
But I want to express my gratitude
