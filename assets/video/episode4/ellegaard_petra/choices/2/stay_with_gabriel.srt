1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
I'm not gonna lie man, but we've pulled through worse, right?

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,860
Have we?

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,620
How's it going?

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,340
Tell me Jesse who is this person?

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,020
He keeps insulting me

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,820
That right there is Magnus. Everyone knows Magnus

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,780
Magnus

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,220
How do I know him exactly you guys defeated the Ender dragon together the most fearsome creature this land has ever seen

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,440
Really?

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,120
Really? You're kind of a big deal. It isn't working

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,500
He doesn't remember talk to him about your past something only you would know about

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,680
Like what talk about fighting the Ender dragon. No, no, no, no anything but that. Come on. It's what you're famous for

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,520
Well, all right then

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,840
the Ender dragon you see it was huge and dangerous and

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,500
And for a while there it looked like we were goners, but you know who stepped in and killed that thing

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,860
Was it Jesse? Huh? No, it was you man. You killed it. Oh

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,860
Thank you for sharing that with me and Jesse. Thank you, too. You've been a big help here

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,660
I need to repay your kindness

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm not sure how exactly

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,140
But I want to express my gratitude
