1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The world needs us, Ruben.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,720
So much of it has already been reduced to bedrock, and it's up to us to save the rest of it.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,040
Well, maybe that is a lot of pressure for just a person and a pig, but we have to find a way.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, you wanted help, do you?

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,560
That's what I said, isn't it? Oh, just as you once helped us before.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,120
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are three of those things now. You say that like it's my fault!

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take responsibility for once, Sorin!

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,520
Sorin, you need to listen to me.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Hush! Ivor, for once!

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,960
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,560
What you don't understand is you are all in very grave danger.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Obviously!

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,720
No, I mean specifically this group. The Weather Storm isn't acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,720
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,720
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
What?

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following Jesse!

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
I didn't know.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
And it's only getting stronger.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
You don't think I realize that?

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Nothing can stop those things!

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Nothing even hurts them!

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Well, except Enderman.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off of us.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
So, enough of them working together might be able to destroy a Weather Storm entirely!

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
Question is, how to bring the Storms and the Endermen together?

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
At least, not from mere mortals.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
I know, I know.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
But I don't think we should let them do that.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
I think we should just let them do what they want.
