1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope that they could fix things, but...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I guess I should have known better.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, you want help, do you?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's what I said, isn't it? Just as you once helped us before.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are three of those things now.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You say that like it's my fault!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take responsibility for once, Soren!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Soren, you need to listen to me!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hush! I vore for once!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What you don't understand is, you are all in very grave danger.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, oh, oh, obviously!

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I mean specifically this group.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Weather Storm isn't acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have the amulet, Ivor, I have all along.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following Jesse!

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I... I didn't know.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger!

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those things! Nothing even hurts them!

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, except Enderman.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off a Weather Storm.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, enough of them working together might be able to destroy a Weather Storm entirely.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen together?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, they're just animals.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're just animals.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They're just animals.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They're just animals.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They're just animals.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're just animals.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're just animals.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're just animals.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They're just animals.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They're just animals.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They're just animals.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They're just animals.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They're just animals.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They're just animals.
