1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,666
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,000
that they could fix things, but...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I guess I should have known better.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, you want help, do you?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,375
That's what I said, isn't it? Just as you once helped us

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,000
before.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,430
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,000
three of those things now.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You say that like it's my fault!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take responsibility for once, Soren!

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Soren, you need to listen to me!

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hush! I vore for once!

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,636
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

16
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:37,000
reason.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,492
What you don't understand is, you are all in very grave

18
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:41,000
danger.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, oh, oh, obviously!

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I mean specifically this group.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,296
The Weather Storm isn't acting randomly, it's following

22
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:51,000
Gabriel.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have the amulet, Ivor, I have all along.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,562
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following

27
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:05,000
Jesse!

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I... I didn't know.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger!

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,103
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those

31
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:14,000
things! Nothing even hurts them!

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, except Enderman.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,178
We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off a

34
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,000
Weather Storm.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,627
So, enough of them working together might be able to

36
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,000
destroy a Weather Storm entirely.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,253
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen

38
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:33,000
together?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, they're just animals.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're just animals.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They're just animals.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They're just animals.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They're just animals.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're just animals.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're just animals.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're just animals.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They're just animals.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They're just animals.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They're just animals.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They're just animals.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They're just animals.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They're just animals.
