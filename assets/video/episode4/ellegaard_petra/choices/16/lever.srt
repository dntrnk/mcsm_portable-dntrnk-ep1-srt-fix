1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see what this sucker does.

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
A secret passageway.

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,873
Why would you build a secret passage in a house that nobody

4
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:26,480
ever visits?

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,440
More like why wouldn't you?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Secret passageways are cool.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Good point.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Are you guys okay?

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
We're fine, but the lever isn't working anymore. Stay

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,900
there. We'll head down and see what we can find

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Wow! What is all this?

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Ha! Incredible! He's gathered them all in one place!

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,880
Gathered what exactly?

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
The treasures of the Order of the Stone!

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
The stories I could tell about these dusty old things.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
You know I often give up on the things that I have.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
But we'll get to that later.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,140
You know, I often give Ivor a hard time, but for all his

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,765
complaining, his time with the Order clearly meant a great

21
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:36,640
deal to him.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, let's go get that enchanting book.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,042
By the stars, the Ender Dragon! With replica Ender crystals

24
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:51,640
in all!

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Wow, I always wondered what it looked like.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Hmm, no way out.

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
It's obviously some kind of puzzle.

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Sorin, what's this thing supposed to be?

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,132
It appears to be an homage to our battle with the Ender

30
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:20,640
Dragon.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Despite his anger, Ivor never stopped being fond of us.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
He was a big part of our team after all.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,640
He knows his days in the Order were his finest.
