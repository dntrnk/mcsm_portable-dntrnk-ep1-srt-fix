Hey Olivia, I think there's some redstone over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,062
Looks like a circuit. We probably just need a lever to

3
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:11,000
power it.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Too bad I don't have one.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, no lever, no functioning circuit.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure what this is for.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure what this is for.
