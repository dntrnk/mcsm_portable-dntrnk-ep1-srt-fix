00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,957
This Ivor character... I'm recalling that he knew something

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:10,000
about potions. Could one of these stop the Wither Monsters?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What do you remember?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,951
I seem to recall that Ivor was... better with potions than

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,000
people. And he... he...

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Keep going.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,971
Ah! Nothing else is coming. Besides the whole Ivor being a

8
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,000
jerk thing.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,113
Potion of blindness, potion of dullness, potion of

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,000
nausea... none of these will help me.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,354
Jesse, am I going to be alright? Or is this just who I am

12
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:42,000
now?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,151
Always struggling to remember what I was. What I'm supposed

14
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:50,000
to be.
