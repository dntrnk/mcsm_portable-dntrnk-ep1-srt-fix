This Ivor character... I'm recalling that he knew something about potions. Could one of these stop the Wither Monsters?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What do you remember?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I seem to recall that Ivor was... better with potions than people. And he... he...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Keep going.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah! Nothing else is coming. Besides the whole Ivor being a jerk thing.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Potion of blindness, potion of dullness, potion of nausea... none of these will help me.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Jesse, am I going to be alright? Or is this just who I am now?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Always struggling to remember what I was. What I'm supposed to be.
