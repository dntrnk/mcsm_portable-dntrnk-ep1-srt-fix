1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
And these are supposed to be the Ender crystals?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,789
Scale models of them. They were the secret to the dragon's

3
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:06,240
demise.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
The secret, huh?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,000
Ha, if only you'd been there. It was a fight for the ages.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,760
We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,974
But even so, the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had

8
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:27,680
imagined.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,735
I realized that it was drawing strength from the Ender

10
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:32,360
crystals,

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,360
and that the crystals had to be destroyed.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,960
I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow,

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,893
the second I destroyed by launching myself on the shockwave

14
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:43,960
of Magnus' TNT.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Using only my strength and my wiles,

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,560
I steered the foul beast toward the third crystal.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,560
I flew the dragon directly toward the final crystal.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
We became heroes, and eventually, legends.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
The greatest the world has ever known.
