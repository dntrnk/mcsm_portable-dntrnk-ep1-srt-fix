1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Finishing what we set out to do.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,200
Cause there's no way we were gonna let a world this cold and torn apart.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,360
We did it!

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,280
Jesse, this is the Nether Star

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,480
that dropped when the wither storm was destroyed.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,480
You wanna do the honors?

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
Oh man, this game is so cool.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
My friends, I am now pleased to introduce to you

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
a new Order of the Stone.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
A new Order of the Stone!

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
And so it was that a new Order of the Stone was born.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
One whose adventures were only just beginning.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
For though the world had been saved and the command block destroyed,

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,720
there are many more worlds than just this one.
