1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
We must be there now, right?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,200
No!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,400
No, we're not even close!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,100
Ooh...

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,400
My rear end is profoundly sore.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,700
Feels like we've been riding forever.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,700
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,000
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of our comprehension.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, please.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,200
The Far Lands are a happy accident.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,400
Nature's way of keeping life interesting.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,000
No, no, no. They are perilous and unpredictable.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
Hold on, back up.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,200
What exactly are the Far Lands?

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,500
Are you being serious?

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,700
The Far Lands lie at the very edge of all things,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,500
where logic gives way to chaos.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,600
They're a dangerous place to visit,

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
and a ridiculous place to construct a laboratory.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,100
Just wait until you see it.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100
Do those two never stop arguing?

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,300
I don't know. I'm too hungry to care.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,500
No kidding. I'm starving.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700
Maybe we should turn back?

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,000
This isn't the time. Swamps are too dangerous.

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,100
Guys, we can't turn back now. Not after coming so far.

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,400
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,300
So am I.

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,400
We mustn't linger long.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,100
The Far Lands are just beyond this swamp.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,100
So this could be our last chance to find food?

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,100
I'll be back.

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
A witch is out.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
We should steer clear of it.

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved.

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,100
Look, a cake! That's enough to feed everyone.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,900
It isn't worth it, Jesse.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Witches hate trespassers.

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,100
Is that a witch?

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Jesse, we shouldn't be here.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Witches are very strong.

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,900
And they know these swamps far better than I.

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,900
I know.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,100
OK guys.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,300
We got deck courses in this place.

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,000
You're kidding, right?

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,500
What a joke.

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,700
Come on.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,400
Love you.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,300
Don't need to ask Rebecca.

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,300
We are congestion affected.

52
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,400
That chip is my hunting Popular Name.

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,400
We can't stay here.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,200
That's what Joe did.
