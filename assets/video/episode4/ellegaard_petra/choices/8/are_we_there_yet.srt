1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Are we there yet? No, no, no, we are not there yet.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,440
Ooh, my rear end is profoundly sore.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
It feels like we've been riding forever.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,760
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,250
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,080
our comprehension.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,080
Oh, please, the Far Lands are a happy accident.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
Nature's way of keeping life interesting.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,080
No, no, no, they are perilous and unpredictable.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Hold on, back up. What exactly are the Far Lands?

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Are you being serious?

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,154
The Far Lands lie at the very edge of all things, where

13
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:48,080
logic gives way to chaos.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,174
They're a dangerous place to visit, and a ridiculous place

15
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:54,080
to construct a laboratory.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Just wait until you see it.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Do those two never stop arguing?

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,080
I don't know. I'm too hungry to care.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
No kidding. I'm starving.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Maybe we should turn back?

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,080
This isn't the time. Swamps are too dangerous.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Guys, we can't turn back now, not after coming so far.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
So am I.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,649
We mustn't linger long. The Far Lands are just beyond this

26
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:26,080
swamp.

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
So this could be our last chance to find food?

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
I'll be back.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
A witch's eye!

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Ah!

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
We should steer clear of it.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Look, a cake! That's enough to feed everyone.

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
It isn't worth it, Jesse.

35
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Witches hate trespassers.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Is that a witch?

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Jesse, we shouldn't be here. Witches are very strong.

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
And they know these swamps far better than I.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Probably in time.
