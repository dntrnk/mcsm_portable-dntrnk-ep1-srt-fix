1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
I've got Petra!

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,560
Then I'll take Gabriel!

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,360
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,440
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,040
Whatever you do, don't look back.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,040
Ah! I look.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,800
Watch it!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
It's gaining on us!

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,840
No offense, but you can use a little practice.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
First time on a horse here!

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
I'll turn around and see if it's gaining,

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
but it's all I can do to hold on.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,360
Jesse, look out!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to get you!

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,920
Am I seeing Enderman attack a weatherstorm?

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
Enderman move floppies, it's what they do!

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
There! We need to get over there!

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,040
Guys, come on!

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
We've got to build a new one.

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Right now.

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Come on, faster!

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
I saw you screaming in my ear!

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Sorry.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We made it!

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We actually freaking made it!

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Hey, how are you feeling?

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
I... I'm afraid I don't feel much like myself at the moment.

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Gabriel!

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,240
Gabriel!

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,520
It really is you!

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
They told us you'd kicked it!

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Who are you people?

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
It's me, Magnus!

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Old friend, don't you recognize us?

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
It's Sorin.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,320
We've known each other for a very long time.
