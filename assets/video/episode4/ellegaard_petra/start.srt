1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Everything in the universe starts out as just a block.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What comes of those blocks is up to those who wield them.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our friends have traveled far and wide in search of the Order of the Stone

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and a way to stop the wither storm for good.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But even well-laid plans can go awry.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The threat to this world, to its very existence, is far from over.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Where am I? What's going on?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Come on, I'm going to get you out of here.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What? Who are you?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Jesse, Jesse, where are you?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're coming!

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No way, no way!

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You found Gabriel?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who's Gabriel?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Get out of here!

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Jesse, you made it!

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And Gabriel?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What did you say? Gabriel?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Look out!

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Those Endermen are running the wrong way! They'll be killed!

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shoren, what do you think you're doing?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These Endermen are running directly into danger!

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're putting us in danger every second you just stand there!

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Whoa!

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesse! They're falling behind!

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Axel, you gotta move faster!

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
She's too sick, and that's the best we can do.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They're not going to be able to outrun it. Not on foot!

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We just need to get them moving faster.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Bingo!

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Everybody, get on!

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Whoa!

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whoa!

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, what about us?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Come on, Jesse, we got this!

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll take the reins, and they can just hang on.
