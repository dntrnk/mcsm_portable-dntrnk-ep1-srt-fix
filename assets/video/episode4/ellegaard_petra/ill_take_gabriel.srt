1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
I'll take Gabriel.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,560
Then I've got Petra.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,240
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,920
Whatever you do, don't look back.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,720
Ah!

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,080
I looked.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,920
Watch out!

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,240
It's gaining on us!

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
We're not gonna make it!

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
Just keep it together, Gabriel.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
Don't let it come any closer!

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm trying!

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
Jesse, look out!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm trying!

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,960
Am I seeing Andermen attack the Wither Storm?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
Andermen move blocks. It's what they do.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,560
There! We need to get over there!

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,480
Don't be rich.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,560
Guys, come on!

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,040
We've got to build a new one, like right now.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
Come on, faster!

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,520
Yee-haw!

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,480
Woo!

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,280
Axel, you're screaming in my ear!

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,200
Sorry.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
We made it!

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
We actually freaking made it!

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
Hey, how are you feeling?

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
I...

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I'm afraid I don't feel much like myself at the moment.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Gabriel!

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
It really is you!

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Gabriel, it really is you!

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
They told us you'd kicked it!

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Who are you people?

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
It's me, Magnus!

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Old friend, don't you recognize us?

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
It's Sorin.

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
We've known each other for a very long time.

52
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm sorry.
