1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Are we there yet? No, no, no, we are not there yet.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ooh, my rear end is profoundly sore.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It feels like we've been riding forever.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,250
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,000
our comprehension.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,146
Oh, please. The Far Lands are a happy accident. Nature's

8
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,000
way of keeping life interesting.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, no, no. They are perilous and unpredictable.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hold on, back up. What exactly are the Far Lands?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,384
Are you being serious? The Far Lands lie at the very edge

12
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:48,000
of all things, where logic gives way to chaos.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,411
They're a dangerous place to visit, and a ridiculous place

14
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,000
to construct a laboratory.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Just wait until you see it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Do those two never stop arguing?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know. I'm too hungry to care.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No kidding. I'm starving. Maybe we should turn back?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This isn't the time. Swamps are too dangerous.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Guys, we can't turn back now, not after coming so far.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So am I.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,569
We mustn't linger long. The Far Lands are just beyond this

24
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:21,000
swamp.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So this could be our last chance to find food?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll be back.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A witch is out.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,370
We should steer clear of it. Nothing good ever happens when

29
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,000
witches are involved.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Look, a cake. That's enough to feed everyone.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It isn't worth it, Jesse.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Witches hate trespassers.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is that a witch?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jesse, we shouldn't be here. Witches are very strong.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And they know these swamps far better than I.
