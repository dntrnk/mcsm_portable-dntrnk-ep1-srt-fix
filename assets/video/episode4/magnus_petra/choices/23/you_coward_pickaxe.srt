1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Soren, you coward, I can't believe you!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I can. Jesse, you can handle things out here, right?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800
What?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,600
I can't let him get himself killed! Just get to the command block and destroy it! Soren!

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,400
So much for the mighty Order of the Stone.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Doesn't matter. We have work to do.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
We need to get those Endermen to attack it!

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
The Tractor Beam! Jesse, that's it!

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Make them chase you into the Tractor Beam!

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
How do you like the bag? Or what? Free?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
How do you like the bag? Or what? Free?

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Yes, they're falling for it!

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Jesse, look! It's working!

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
That hole's big enough to get inside of.

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Now we just need to find you a way up.

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Or build you a way up.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
That's it! Everyone, empty your pockets!

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Let's see...

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I've got Redstone and Cobblestone from Iowars Armory.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I've got some TNT from Boomtown.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
I've got Pistons, Repeaters, and...

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
I've got Pistons, Repeaters, and...

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I've got Pistons, Repeaters, and...

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I've got Pistons, Repeaters, and...

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
I've got Pistons, Repeaters, and...

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,800
I've got Pistons, Repeaters, some wool, some leftover slime...

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Oh, and I still have that Minecart.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
That's gotta be enough to make something, right?

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I mean, if we use the TNT on, say...

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
The Minecart?

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Or those Pistons...

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
And we do have all that Cobblestone.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Maybe we could build a ramp?

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Or even go straight up vertically.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Or find a way to use Redstone.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
We're close to an answer. I can feel it!
