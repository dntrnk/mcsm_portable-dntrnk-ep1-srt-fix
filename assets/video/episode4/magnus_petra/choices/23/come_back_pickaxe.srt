1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Soren come back here dude, what a chicken

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,680
Jesse you can handle things out here, right? What I can't let him get himself killed

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,240
Just get to the command block and destroy it

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,040
Sorry, so much for the mighty order of the stone

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Doesn't matter. We have work to do

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
We need to get those Enderman to attack it

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Tractor beam Jesse that's it

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,240
Make them chase you into the tractor beam

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, they're falling for it

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jesse look, it's working

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now we just need to find you a way up

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
Everyone empty your pockets. Let's see

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
I've got redstone and cobblestone from I Wars army. I have some TNT from boomtown

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,560
I've got pistons repeaters some wool some leftover slime

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,040
Oh, and I still have that minecart. That's gotta be enough to make something

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm gonna go get some more of that

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm gonna go get some more of that

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm gonna go get some more of that

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm gonna go get some more of that

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,320
And I still have that minecart that's gotta be enough to make something right?

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,360
I mean if we use the TNT on say the minecart or those pistons and we do have all that cobblestone

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,320
Maybe we could build a ramp or even go straight up vertically or find a way to use redstone

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
We're close to an answer. I can feel it
