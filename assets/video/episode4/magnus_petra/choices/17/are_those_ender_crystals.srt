1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
And these are supposed to be the Ender crystals?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,789
Scale models of them. They were the secret to the dragon's

3
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:06,240
demise.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
A secret, huh?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,000
Ha, if only you'd been there. It was a fight for the ages.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,760
We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,024
But even so, the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had

8
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:27,760
imagined.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,052
I realized that it was drawing strength from the Ender

10
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:35,520
crystals, and that the crystals had to be destroyed.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,872
I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow, the second I

12
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:44,077
destroyed by launching myself on the shockwave of Magnus'

13
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:44,520
TNT.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,313
Using only my strength and my wiles, I steered the foul

15
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:51,520
beast toward the third crystal.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I flew the dragon directly toward the final crystal.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow.

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,280
We became heroes, and eventually, legends.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
The greatest the world has ever known.
