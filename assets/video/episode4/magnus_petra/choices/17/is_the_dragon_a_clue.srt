1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're missing something here, Sorin.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,977
And I have a feeling the key might be locked in that head

3
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:05,500
of yours.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,000
I have a key locked in my head?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,923
What I'm saying is, I think you need to tell me about the

6
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,000
Ender Dragon battle.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh! Ha, if only you'd been there.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It was a fight for the ages.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,970
But even so, the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,000
imagined.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,532
I realized that it was drawing strength from the Ender

13
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:38,000
Crystals, and that the Crystals had to be destroyed.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,836
I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow, the second I

15
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:47,508
destroyed by launching myself on the shockwave of Magnus'

16
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,000
TNT.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,425
Using only my strength and my wiles, I steered the foul

18
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:56,000
beast toward the third crystal.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I flew the dragon directly toward the final crystal.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We became heroes, and eventually, legends.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The greatest the world has ever known.
