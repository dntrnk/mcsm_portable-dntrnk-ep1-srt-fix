00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Awesome! I've never owned a diamond weapon!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just wait till you enchant it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Behold! My enchanted diamond pickaxe!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, that should do the job nicely.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But if you're fighting those Wither Monsters head on, you'll want better armor too.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I enchanted these for the Order. They're about as strong as it comes.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even able to withstand TNT!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any preference?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, I kinda wanna keep the armor I'm already wearing.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Really?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I mean, Magnus died so I could have it, you know?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Come to think of it, he would have liked that. Very well.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Nice weapon, Jesse!

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thanks!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But at least take some for your friends.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sounds good to me.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's get back to Soren's fortress and see how the Witherstorms are doing against those Endermen.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure what's going on here.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My poor fortress!

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see Endermen, so this means the plan's working, right?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shouldn't the Endermen have dismantled those things already?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or am I just confused?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not just you. Something's wrong.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Jesse, over here!

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Axle!

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You guys made it!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nice freakin' armor, by the way.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you still have the amulet?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Safe and sound. That's not the problem.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then what is?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Endermen. They're not angry enough.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I mean, some of them are, but a lot of them are just standing around moving blocks.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, being Endermen.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ugh! Blast!

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, it's nothing we can't handle, right?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not so sure about that.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now is not the time for cold feet, Soren!

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So what's the plan?

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean, I know we gotta go in there, but...

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do we just go for it, or what?
