1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
You can thank me by watching out for me and my friends. This fight isn't over yet.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,600
Very well.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,600
It was dark and foul, and I was sure I was a goner.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, you aren't. You made it back alive, which is more than I can say for some of us.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, Magnus. For a second there, I almost managed to forget.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You guys talking about Magnus?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I still can't believe he's gone.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Guys, it was my fault. I'm the one who took Magnus's armor.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ah! Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why is that thing still alive?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So the command block is still out there? Oh, great.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The question is, what do we do?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I need a moment to think.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is he always like this?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You have no idea.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That jacket! I recognize it!

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Lucas always wears that jacket.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It hurts just to think about it.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just put it out of your mind.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I mean, do you think?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the witherstorm...
