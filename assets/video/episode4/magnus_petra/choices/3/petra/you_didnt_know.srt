1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There's no way you could have known what would happen. No one's ever seen anything like this.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Still, I'm gonna do everything I can to make this right.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Petra, I know this isn't easy to hear, but you're too sick to be going anywhere.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not that sick.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe you should rest in this cave for a while. I mean, it's safe, defensible.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you say I'm fine, then I'm... fine.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You staying here is the right move. You'll never get better if we keep pushing you.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But I want to be there for you guys.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I know you do, and you will.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe you're right. It's the right call, Jesse.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I hope so.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We didn't all make it back, though.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Guys, it was my fault.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm the one who took Magnus's armor.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why is that thing still alive?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, it ripped the witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So the command block is still out there?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, great.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The question is, what do we do?

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why are you asking me?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I need a moment to think.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is he always like this?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You have no idea.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That jacket! I recognize it!

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Lucas always wears that jacket.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No. There were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It hurts just to think about it.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Just put it out of your mind.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jesse, if what Gabriel said is true...

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I mean, do you think?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the witherstorm...
