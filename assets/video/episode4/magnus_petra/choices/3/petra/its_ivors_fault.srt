1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
This isn't your fault. It's Ivor's who wouldn't do something stupid for a diamond

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,040
But without my help Ivor wouldn't have wouldn't have wanted revenge on Gabriel

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Believe me. He would have found another way. I'm gonna do everything I can to make this right

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,720
Petra I know this isn't easy to hear but you're too sick to be going anywhere. I'm not that sick

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,780
Maybe you should rest in this cave for a while. I mean it's safe

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,960
Defensible I say I'm fine then I'm

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,160
Fine

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
You staying here is the right move

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,680
You'll never get better if we keep pushing you but I want to be there for you guys. I know you do and you will

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,000
Maybe you're right. It's the right call Jesse. I hope so. We didn't all make it back though

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Guys it was my fault

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm the one who took Magnus's armor, but you couldn't have known what was going to happen

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,880
She's right. You can't blame yourself. Jesse. I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Being emotional is getting us nowhere

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,960
What I want to know is what happened out there today? Why is that thing still alive?

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,480
The formidable just wasn't strong enough. I mean it ripped the wither storm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,600
So the command block is still out there. Oh

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
Great

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Look our plan didn't work. So we obviously need a new one

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,120
Question is what do we do?

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,880
Why are you asking me am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Huh? I need a moment to think

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,760
Is he always like this you have no idea?

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,360
That jacket I recognize it

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:12,480
Lucas always wears that jacket. No, there were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
It hurts just to think about just put it out of your mind

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,600
Jesse if what Gabriel said is true, I

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,320
Mean do you think I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the wither storm

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
You
