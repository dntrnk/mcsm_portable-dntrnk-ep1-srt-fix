1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope that they could fix things, but guess I should have known better.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, you want help, do you? That's what I said, isn't it? Just as you once helped us before.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are three of those things now.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You say that like it's my fault!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take responsibility for once, Soren!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Soren, you need to listen to me.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hush, I vore for once!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason. What you don't understand is you are all in very grave danger.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I mean specifically this group.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Witherstorm isn't acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What? Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following Jesse!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I didn't know.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't think I realize that. Nothing can stop those things. Nothing even hurts them.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, except Enderman. We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off a Witherstorm.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, enough of them working together might be able to destroy a Witherstorm entirely.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen together?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets. They don't follow orders.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At least, not from mere mortals.
