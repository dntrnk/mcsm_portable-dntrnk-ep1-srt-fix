1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,636
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,404
that they could fix things, but guess I should have known

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:08,000
better.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,307
Oh, you want help, do you? That's what I said, isn't it?

6
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:21,000
Just as you once helped us before.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,430
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,000
three of those things now.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You say that like it's my fault!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is your fault!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take responsibility for once, Soren!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Soren, you need to listen to me.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hush, I vore for once!

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,147
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

15
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,186
reason. What you don't understand is you are all in very

16
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:41,000
grave danger.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously!

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I mean specifically this group.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,274
The Witherstorm isn't acting randomly, it's following

20
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:51,000
Gabriel.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,028
What? Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's

24
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:05,000
following Jesse!

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I didn't know.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,103
You don't think I realize that. Nothing can stop those

28
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:14,000
things. Nothing even hurts them.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,446
Well, except Enderman. We actually just saw a bunch of

30
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,000
Endermen pull blocks off a Witherstorm.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,333
So, enough of them working together might be able to

32
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,000
destroy a Witherstorm entirely.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,253
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen

34
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:33,000
together?

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets. They don't follow orders.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At least, not from mere mortals.
