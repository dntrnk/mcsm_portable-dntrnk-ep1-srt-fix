1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The world needs us, Ruben.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,720
So much of it has already been reduced to bedrock, and it's up to us to save the rest of it.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,040
Well, maybe that is a lot of pressure for just a person and a pig, but we have to find a way.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, you wanted help, do you?

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,560
That's what I said, isn't it? Oh, just as you once helped us before.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,040
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are three of those things now. You say that like it's my fault!

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,520
It is your fault! I'll take responsibility for once, Soren. Soren, you need to listen to me. Hush, Ivor, for once!

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,560
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason. What you don't understand is you are all in very grave danger.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,720
Obviously! No, I mean specifically this group. The Witherstorm isn't acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I have the amulet, Ivor. I have all along.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
What?

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following Jesse!

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I... I didn't know.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
And it's only getting stronger!

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,360
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those things! Nothing even hurts them!

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, except Enderman. We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off a Witherstorm.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, enough of them working together might be able to destroy a Witherstorm entirely.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen together?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Thanks for watching!
