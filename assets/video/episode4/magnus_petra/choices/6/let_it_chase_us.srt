00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The Witherstorms are already chasing us. If we just get them to chase us to your fortress again...

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,320
They'll be caught between a rock and a hard place!

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,920
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the command block!

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,960
Yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not even a Formita Bomb.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,040
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
What kind of failsafe exactly?

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,400
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the command block itself.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,880
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits. Forever!

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
Yes. Yes, that's it!

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Ivor? Well, I'll be. It is you.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,400
A pleasure, as always, Eligard. It just keeps coming for us.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivor says it's because of the amulet that Gabriel...

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,440
The point is we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as long as we have that amulet.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,320
I'll take it. I'll keep the Witherstorms busy. You guys do what you gotta do.

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
Axel, thank you.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,480
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at Soren's fortress.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,080
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm going with him.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
I appreciate that.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,880
Well, I'm going with Jesse. I pledge to help, and that's what I must do.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
Everyone, take good care of yourselves.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,080
Hey, Jesse, let's try our handshake again, just once for the road.
