1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We need to find a way for me to use this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Whoa, that is, without question, the coolest thing I have ever, ever seen.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, and I brought you some armor, Axel.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nice! I was feeling a little left out.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Does anyone see the command block?

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We don't think it's exposed!

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We need to get out of here!

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Command block?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We don't think it's exposed!

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We need to get more Endermen focused on the Winter Store!

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How do you make Endermen focus? I can't even make myself focus.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We shouldn't be here. Not if this is going according to plan.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Soren? What are you doing?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I, uh, you know, I really enjoy meeting you all, but...

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Soren!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Did Soren just run away?
