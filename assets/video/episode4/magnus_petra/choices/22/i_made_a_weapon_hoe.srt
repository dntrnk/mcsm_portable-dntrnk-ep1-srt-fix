1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We need to find a way for me to use this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,621
Whoa, that is, without question, the coolest thing I have

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,000
ever, ever seen.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, and I brought you some armor, Axel.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nice! I was feeling a little left out.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Does anyone see the command block?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We don't think it's exposed!

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We need to get out of here!

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Command block?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We don't think it's exposed!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We need to get more Endermen focused on the Winter Store!

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,555
How do you make Endermen focus? I can't even make myself

16
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:03,000
focus.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,606
We shouldn't be here. Not if this is going according to

18
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:07,000
plan.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Soren? What are you doing?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I, uh, you know, I really enjoy meeting you all, but...

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Soren!

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Did Soren just run away?
