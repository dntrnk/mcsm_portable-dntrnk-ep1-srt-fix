00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Guys, check it out. We use the pistons and some redstone to build a flying machine.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then when I'm high enough, I ignite the TNT and blast myself into the wither storm.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heck yeah! I love that idea.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Look out!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Axle!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No!

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I can't hold on!

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I got you!

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Lucas! You're here!

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Lucas, thank you.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Anything for us, right?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, it's finished.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Quick, climb on!

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And Jesse, I know you can do this.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We all do.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now go to walls that command block.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ruben, this is no place for a...

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Wow!

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No!

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There it is.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We meet again, command block.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ruben, I think we made it angry.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Holy moly!

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
At least they won't die!

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ruben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command block.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The tractor beams!

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey, you!

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The tractor beams!

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey, you!
