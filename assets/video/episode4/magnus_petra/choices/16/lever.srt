1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see what this sucker does.

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
A secret passageway.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,560
Why would you build a secret passage in a house that nobody ever visits?

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,440
More like why wouldn't you?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Secret passageways are cool.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Good point.

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Are you guys okay?

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,900
We're fine, but the lever isn't working anymore. Stay there. We'll head down and see what we can find

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What is all this?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Incredible. He's gathered them all in one place.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Gathered what exactly?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The treasures of the Order of the Stone.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The stories I could tell about these dusty old things.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know, I often give up on my family.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, I often give Ivor a hard time, but for all his complaining, his time with the Order clearly meant a great deal to him.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, let's go get that enchanting book.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
By the stars, the Ender Dragon. With replica ender crystals in all.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wow, I always wondered what it looked like.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hmm, no way out.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's obviously some kind of puzzle.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sorin, what's this thing supposed to be?

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It appears to be an homage to our battle with the Ender Dragon.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Despite its name, it's still a treasure.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It appears to be an homage to our battle with the Ender Dragon.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Despite its anger, Ivor never stopped being fond of us.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He was a big part of our team after all.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He knows his days in the Order were his finest.
