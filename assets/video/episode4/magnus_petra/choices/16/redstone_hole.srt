Hey Olivia, I think there's some redstone over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,062
Looks like a circuit. We probably just need a lever to

3
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:11,000
power it.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Too bad I don't have one.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, no lever, no functioning circuit.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Thanks for watching!
