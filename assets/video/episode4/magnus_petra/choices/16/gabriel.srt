00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,581
This Ivor character... I'm recalling that he knew something

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:07,000
about potions.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Could one of these stop the Wither Monsters?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What do you remember?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,951
I seem to recall that Ivor was... better with potions than

6
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,000
people. And he... he...

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Keep going.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,971
Ah, nothing else is coming. Besides the whole Ivor being a

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,000
jerk thing.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,113
Potion of blindness, potion of dullness, potion of

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,000
nausea... none of these will help me.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,354
Jesse, am I going to be alright? Or is this just who I am

13
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:42,000
now?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,151
Always struggling to remember what I was. What I'm supposed

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:50,000
to be.
