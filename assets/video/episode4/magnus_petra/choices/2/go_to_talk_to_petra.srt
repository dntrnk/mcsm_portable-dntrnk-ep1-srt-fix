You feeling any better?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Better is relative. If I just sit here and don't move or breathe, it's almost bearable.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Man, if it wasn't for Ivor, she wouldn't even be like this.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No kidding. That's not exactly true. Ivor built the wither, sure, but he couldn't have done it without that skull I gave him.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If I'd just taken a second to think about it, all I cared about was getting that stupid diamond.
