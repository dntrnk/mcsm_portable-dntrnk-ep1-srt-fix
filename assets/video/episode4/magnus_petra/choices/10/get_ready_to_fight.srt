1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Everyone, this could be a really nasty fight.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,200
The rest of you go!

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,300
Hold them off!

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,800
What? Ivor, no!

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,300
There's no time to argue.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,000
Just head for the corner of the glitch wall!

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,600
The what wall?

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,387
Hey, you witch! You're not the only one who can draw a

9
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:16,800
potion!

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Come on!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Wow!

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
You lost them for wow?

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
What is that?

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Oh...

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Wow...

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,300
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,936
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I'm the only one who can draw a

21
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:58,300
potion.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,300
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,403
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall

24
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:13,300
thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,300
I'd rather be hungry than killed by a witch.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I'd rather be eating dinner.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,300
Quite a sight, isn't it?

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,800
Sauron, have you been here before?

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,300
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,159
How can Ivor live here? I mean, it's one thing to build a

32
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,800
wall world inside the End, but this...

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,300
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,903
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

35
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:50,300
research.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,262
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well

37
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:54,800
guarded.

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm sure he lives here.

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,800
This way, I suspect.

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,878
I'd feel better about this if the rest of our group was

41
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:07,300
with us.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,800
Come on!

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,800
Is this... a maze?

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,800
It would appear so.

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,800
A massive one from the looks of it.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,460
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,800
unspeakable peril.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,286
Why do I sense that entering this so-called maze would be a

49
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:47,300
grave mistake?

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,300
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,800
There has to be another way.

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,800
A secret door, or... I don't know.

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,800
Somewhere around.
