1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We need to distract them! Get out of here!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Fine! But how?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The rest of you go!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll hold them off!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What? Ivor, no!

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's no time to argue.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Just head for the corner of the glitch wall!

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The what wall?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,612
Hey you, witch! You're not the only one who can draw a

10
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:17,000
potion!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Come on!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Guys, I think we lost them for...

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You lost them for wow?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is that?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh...

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wow!

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Welcome to the Far Land.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,103
I'd feel a lot better about going into this crazy wall

22
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:00,000
thingy if I wasn't still hungry.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'd rather be hungry than killed by a witch.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd rather be eating dinner.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Quite a sight, isn't it?

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sauron, have you been here before?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How can Ivor live here?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,819
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the

37
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,000
End, but this...

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,523
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive

40
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:50,000
research.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,462
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well

42
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:54,000
guarded.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This way, I suspect.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,578
I'd feel better about this if the rest of our group was

45
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:06,000
with us.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Come on!

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is this... a maze?

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It would appear so.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A massive one from the looks of it.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,597
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold

51
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,000
a speaking peril.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,783
Why do I sense that entering this so-called maze would be a

53
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,000
grave mistake?

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,619
Because some part of you said you were going to enter the

55
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:43,000
maze.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not going to enter the maze.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The so-called maze would be a grave mistake.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There has to be another way.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
A secret door, or... I don't know.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Some way around.
