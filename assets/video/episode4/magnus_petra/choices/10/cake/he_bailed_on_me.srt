1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Come on!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Wow!

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
What is that?

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh... wow.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
It's like we're at the edge of the world.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
Say what you like about witches.

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,980
They sure know how to make a cake.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Quite a sight, isn't it?

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,980
Sworn, have you been here before?

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,980
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,980
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,980
How can Ivor live here?

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,980
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End,

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,980
but this...

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,980
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,980
Whatever Ivor is hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,980
This way, I suspect.

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,980
I'd feel better about this if the rest of our group was with us.

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
Come on!

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Is this... a maze?

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,980
It would appear so.

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,980
A massive one from the looks of it.

32
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,980
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold unspeakable peril.

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Why do I sense that entering this maze is a good idea?

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,980
I'm not sure.

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,980
I'm not sure.

36
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
I'm not sure.

37
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
I'm not sure.

38
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm not sure.

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,980
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
I'm not sure.

42
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,980
I'm not sure.

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,980
I'm not sure.

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980
I'm not sure.

45
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,980
I'm not sure.

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,980
I'm not sure.

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm not sure.

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
I'm not sure.

49
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,980
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,980
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm not sure.

52
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
I'm not sure.

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,980
I'm not sure.

54
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
I'm not sure.
