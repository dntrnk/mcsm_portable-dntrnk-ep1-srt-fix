1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know, he disappeared outside the witch's hut!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Curse that fool of a man!

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Come on!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Guys, I think we lost them for...

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Wow!

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
You lost them for wow?

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,400
What is that?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Oh... wow...

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,400
It's like we're at the edge of the world!

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,000
Actually, we seem to be at the corner of it.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome to the Far Lands, my friend.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Say what you like about witches.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,600
They sure know how to make a cake.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,800
Quite a sight, isn't it?

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
Swarn, have you been here before?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Not here specifically, but I have visited the Far Lands.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The Order traveled far and wide during our heyday.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,800
How can Ivor live here?

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I mean, it's one thing to build a wall world inside the End,

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
but this...

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, I doubt he lives here.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,400
He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Whatever Ivor's hiding in here, it will be extremely well guarded.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
This way, I suspect.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,800
I'd feel better about this if the rest of our group was with us.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Come on!

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Is this... a maze?

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
It would appear so.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
A massive one from the looks of it.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,800
If Ivor used the command block to build this, it could hold unspeakable peril.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Why do I sense that entering this place is so dangerous?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm sure Ivor would have been able to do it.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm sure Ivor would have been able to do it.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm sure Ivor would have been able to do it.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm sure Ivor would have been able to do it.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm sure Ivor would have been able to do it.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Why do I sense that entering this so-called maze would be a grave mistake?

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Because some part of you still knows Ivor.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,400
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way forward.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
There has to be another way.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,800
A secret door, or... I don't know...

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
Some way around.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm sure Ivor would have been able to do it.
