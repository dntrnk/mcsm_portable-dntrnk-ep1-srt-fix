1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,340
I've got Petra!

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,640
Then I'll take Gabriel!

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,440
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,440
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,140
Whatever you do, don't look back.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,240
I won't.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,940
Watch it!

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,340
It's gaining on us!

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,940
No offense, but you can use a little practice.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,540
First time on a horse here!

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
I turn around to see if it's gaining,

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,640
but it's all I can do to hold on.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,400
Jesse, look out!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm going to get you!

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Am I seeing Enderman attack a weather storm?

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,200
Enderman move blocks, it's what they do!

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,400
There, we need to get over that!

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,500
Courage!

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Guys, come on!

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,400
We gotta build a new one, like right now.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Come on, faster!

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,700
I saw you screaming in my ear!

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorry.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We made it!

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,400
We actually freaking made it!

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Hey, how are you feeling?

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I...

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm afraid I don't feel much like myself at the moment.

29
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Gabriel!

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Gabriel!

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
It really is you!

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, I knew if anybody could outrun death it would be you!

46
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Who are you people?

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's me, Elegard, come on!

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,400
Old friend, don't you recognize us?

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,600
It's Sorin.

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,400
We've known each other for a very long time.
