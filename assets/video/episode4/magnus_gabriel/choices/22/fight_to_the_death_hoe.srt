1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We confront the Witherstorm and fight it to the death.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah! You do mean it's death, right?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Axel, just put on your helmet.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What helmet?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Nice! I was feeling a little left out.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Guys, let's go kick some command block butt.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Woohoo!

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Does anyone see the command block?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't think it's exposed.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We need to get more Endermen focused on the Witherstorm.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,555
How do you make Endermen focus? I can't even make myself

13
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,000
focus.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,619
We shouldn't be here. Not that this is going according to

15
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,000
plan.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Soren, what are you doing?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I, uh, you know, I've really enjoyed meeting you all, but...

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Soren!

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Did Soren just run away?
