1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Soren come back here dude, what a chicken

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,720
Jesse you can handle things out here, right? What I can't let him get himself killed

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,160
Just get to the command block and destroy it. Sorry

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,080
So much for the mighty order of the stone

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Doesn't matter. We have work to do

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
We need to get those Enderman to attack it

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Tractor beam Jesse that's it

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
Make them chase you into the tractor beam

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,800
Yes

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Jesse boiling

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now we just need to find you a way up

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,260
Build you a way up. That's it. Everyone empty your pockets. Let's see

14
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,840
I've got redstone and cobblestone from Ivor's armory. I have some TNT from boom town got Pistons repeaters

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,220
Look, it gave me some more. I took some slime from the maze. Oh, and they still have that minecart

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,320
That's gotta be enough to make something right?

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,300
I mean if we use the TNT on say minecart or those piston and we do have all that cobblestone

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,260
Maybe we could build a ramp or even go straight up vertically or find a way to use redstone

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,380
We're close to an answer. I can feel it
