1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Are we there yet? No, no, no, we are not there yet.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,840
My butt's never been so sore in my life.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,640
Not that I'd remember.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,340
Feels like we've been riding forever.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,220
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,725
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of

7
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:27,560
our comprehension.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Oh, please. The Far Lands are a happy accident.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,920
Nature's way of keeping life interesting.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,620
No, no, no. They are perilous and unpredictable.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,800
Hold on, back up. What exactly are the Far Lands?

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,140
Are you being serious?

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,214
The Far Lands lie at the very edge of all things, where

14
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,140
logic gives way to chaos.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,756
They're a dangerous place to visit, and a ridiculous place

16
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,440
to construct a laboratory.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,720
Just wait until you see it.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Do those two never stop arguing?

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,880
You asking me? All I can think about is food.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,880
No kidding. I'm starving.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Maybe we should turn back?

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,380
This isn't the time. Swamps are too dangerous.

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,400
Guys, we can't turn back now, not after coming so far.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,900
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,900
So am I.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,969
We mustn't linger long. The Far Lands are just beyond this

27
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:26,400
swamp.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880
So this could be our last chance to find food?

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
I'll be back.

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,880
A witch is out. We should steer clear of it.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Look, a cake! That's enough to feed everyone.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,040
It isn't worth it, Jesse. Witches hate trespassers.

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Is that a witch?

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Jesse, we shouldn't be here. Witches are very strong.

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
And they know these swamps far better than I.
