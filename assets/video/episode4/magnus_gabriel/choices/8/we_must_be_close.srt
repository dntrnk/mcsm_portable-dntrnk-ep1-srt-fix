1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
We must be there now, right?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,100
No.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,300
No, we're not even close!

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,600
My butt's never been so sore in my life.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
Not that I'd remember.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,100
Feels like we've been riding forever.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,100
I am telling you, we cannot go to the Far Lands.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,400
They're not just the edge of our world, but the limits of our comprehension.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Oh, please.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,600
The Far Lands are a happy accident.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,800
Nature's way of keeping life interesting.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
No, no, no. They are perilous and unpredictable.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,900
Hold on, back up.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
What exactly are the Far Lands?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
Are you being serious?

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
The Far Lands lie at the very edge of all things,

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,100
where logic gives way to chaos.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
They're a dangerous place to visit,

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,400
and a ridiculous place to construct a laboratory.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
Just wait until you see it.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,600
Do those two never stop arguing?

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
You asking me?

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
All I can think about is food.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No kidding.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,800
I'm starving.

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,900
Maybe we should turn back?

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,700
This isn't the time.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,200
Swamps are too dangerous.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,400
Guys, we can't turn back now, not after coming so far.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,700
Fine, but I'm taking a break.

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,600
So am I.

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
We mustn't linger long.

33
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,300
The Far Lands are just beyond this swamp.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,300
So this could be our last chance to find food?

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,300
I'll be back.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
A witch is out.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,900
We should steer clear of it.

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,100
Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Look, a cake! That's enough to feed everyone.

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,100
It isn't worth it, Jesse.

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,500
Witches hate trespassers.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Is that a witch?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Jesse, we shouldn't be here.

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,000
Witches are very strong.

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,000
And they know these swamps far better than I.

46
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
You want to make excuses

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,400
...

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,600
...

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,600
...

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,800
...

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,100
...
