00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Guys, check it out. We use the pistons and some redstone to build a flying machine.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then when I'm high enough, I ignite the TNT and blast myself into the wither storm.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heck yeah! I love that idea.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry up and...

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, look out!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Petra!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Axel!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Gah!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can't... hold on!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I got you!

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Lucas! You're here!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Ocelots, distract that wither storm!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey you! Get a load of this!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Lucas, thank you.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Anything for a friend.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now let's hurry up and build this thing.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, it's finished.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Quick, climb on!

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Jesse, you can do this. I know you can.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We all do.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thanks guys. It means a lot.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now go to the walls that command block.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ruben, there's no place for a...

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wow...

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Gah!

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There it is.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We meet again, command block.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now it's time to destroy you.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ruben, I think we made it angry.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's doing everything it can to protect the command block.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to get you, Ruben.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Protect the command block.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Awesome weapon, don't fail me now.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Holy moly!

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Still on time!

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ruben, whatever happens, we have to destroy that command block.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait a second, I know exactly how to get up there.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The tractor beam!

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, you!

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The tractor beam!

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey, you!
