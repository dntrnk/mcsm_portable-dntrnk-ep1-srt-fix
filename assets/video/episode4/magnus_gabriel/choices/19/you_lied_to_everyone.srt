1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Why would you do that? You lied, even to your closest friends!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All I can say is...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I was a fool.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So you finally admit it.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Soren, how could you?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ivor, how long have you guys been standing there?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Long enough that they heard the whole thing.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we're liars, all of us.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You didn't think you could keep it secret forever, did you, Soren?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is this why you left the Order? Because Soren lied?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because they all did.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Soren, Gabriel, Magnus, Eligard, they agreed to keep this a secret.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And you? You agreed to stay quiet too, in exchange for all of our treasures.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've technically never told anybody.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So this whole thing, the wither you unleashed, it's all been to teach the Order a lesson?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To teach the world a lesson! To show you who the Order really are.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Liars, cowards! And now, they know.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, I suppose they do.
