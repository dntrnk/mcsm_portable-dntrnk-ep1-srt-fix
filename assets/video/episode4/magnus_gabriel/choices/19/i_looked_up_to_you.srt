1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Soren, I looked up to you. The whole world did.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Nobody is more ashamed than me.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So you finally admit it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Soren, how could you?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Ivor, how long have you guys been standing there?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Long enough that they heard the whole thing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're liars. All of us.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You didn't think you could keep it secret forever, did you, Soren?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Is this why you left the Order? Because Soren lied?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because they all did.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Soren, Gabriel, Magnus, Eligard. They agreed to keep this a secret.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And you? You agreed to stay quiet too, in exchange for all of our treasures.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've technically never told anybody.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So this whole thing, the wither you unleashed, it's all been to teach the Order a lesson?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To teach the world a lesson. To show you who the Order really are.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Liars, cowards. And now, they know.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes. I suppose they do.
