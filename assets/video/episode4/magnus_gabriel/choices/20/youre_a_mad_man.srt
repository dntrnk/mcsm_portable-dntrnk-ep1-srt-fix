1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
Ivory you're a madman

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,641
In all your scheming to expose the order you've nearly

3
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:06,000
destroyed the known world

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,149
My wither plan obviously backfired. Yeah, thank I didn't

5
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:13,635
know we'd end up with three of those things tearing the

6
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:14,460
world apart

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,068
Which brings us back to why we're here. We need to destroy

8
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:20,820
that command block like now

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Jesse's right

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
Destroying the command block is all that matters anymore

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
How

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
Ironic that the best thing the command block gave us was

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,200
the very means to destroy it

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,183
So the enchanting book, what do we do with it? You craft a

15
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:41,000
weapon then put it on an anvil follow me

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
I'll show you hi, Vore

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,120
About everything. Yes. Well, it doesn't matter now

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,452
Grab some ingredients and craft a weapon. I'll show you how

20
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:00,840
to enchant it sweet

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,961
Let's see there's a bunch of crafting stuff and diamond

22
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,560
score

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
You
