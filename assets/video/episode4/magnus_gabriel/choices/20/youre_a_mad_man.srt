1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
Ivory you're a madman

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,000
In all your scheming to expose the order you've nearly destroyed the known world

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,460
My wither plan obviously backfired. Yeah, thank I didn't know we'd end up with three of those things tearing the world apart

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,820
Which brings us back to why we're here. We need to destroy that command block like now

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Jesse's right

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
Destroying the command block is all that matters anymore

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
How

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,200
Ironic that the best thing the command block gave us was the very means to destroy it

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,000
So the enchanting book, what do we do with it? You craft a weapon then put it on an anvil follow me

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
I'll show you hi, Vore

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,120
About everything. Yes. Well, it doesn't matter now

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,840
Grab some ingredients and craft a weapon. I'll show you how to enchant it sweet

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,560
Let's see there's a bunch of crafting stuff and diamond score

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
You
