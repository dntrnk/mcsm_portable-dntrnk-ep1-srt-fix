1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see what this sucker does.

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,720
Secret passageway! Cool!

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,760
Why would you build a secret passage in a house that nobody ever visits?

4
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,100
More like why wouldn't you?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Secret passageways are cool.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,240
Good point.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,280
Are you guys okay?

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,780
We're fine, but the lever isn't working anymore.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,000
Stay there! We'll head down and see what we can find!

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wow, what is all this?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ha! Incredible! He's gathered them all in one place!

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Gathered what exactly?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The treasures of the Order of the Stone!

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The stories I could tell about these dusty old things.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You know, I often give up on the things I know.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You know, I often give Ivor a hard time, but for all his complaining,

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
his time with the Order clearly meant a great deal to him.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, let's go get that enchanting book.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
By the stars, the Ender Dragon! With replica ender crystals in all!

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wow, I always wondered what it looked like.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hmm, no way out.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's obviously some kind of puzzle.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sorin, what's this thing supposed to be?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It appears to be an homage to our battle with the Ender Dragon.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Despite his anger, Ivor never stopped being fond of us.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He was a big part of our team, after all.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He knows his days in the Order were his finest.
