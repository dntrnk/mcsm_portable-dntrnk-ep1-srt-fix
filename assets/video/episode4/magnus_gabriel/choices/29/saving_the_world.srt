1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Finishing what we set out to do.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,240
Cause there's no way we were gonna let a world this cool

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,040
get torn apart.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,360
We did it!

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,879
Jesse, this Nether Star is all that remained when the

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,760
Wither Storm was destroyed.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Would you please do the honors?

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Oh man, this game is so cool.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,840
My friends, I am now pleased to introduce to you...

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
A new Order of the Stone!

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
And so it was that a new Order of the Stone was born.

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
One whose adventures were only just beginning.

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,192
For though the world had been saved and the command block

14
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:37,840
destroyed,

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
there are many more worlds than just this one.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thanks for watching!
