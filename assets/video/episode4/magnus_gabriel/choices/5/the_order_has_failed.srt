1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope that they could fix things, but guess I should have known better.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, you want help, do you? That's what I said, isn't it? Just as you once helped us before.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are three of those things now.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You say that like it's my fault! It is your fault!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Take responsibility for once, Soren. Soren, you need to listen to me.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hush, Ivor, for once!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason. What you don't understand is, you are all in very grave danger.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, I mean specifically this group. The Winter Storm isn't acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have the amulet, Ivor, I have all along.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What? Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's following Jesse!

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I... I didn't know.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger!

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those things! Nothing even hurts them!

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, except Enderman. We actually just saw a bunch of Endermen pull blocks off a wither storm.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, enough of them working together might be able to destroy a wither storm entirely.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen together?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, they're just animals.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're just animals.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They're just animals.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They're just animals.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They're just animals.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're just animals.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're just animals.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're just animals.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They're just animals.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They're just animals.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They're just animals.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They're just animals.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They're just animals.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They're just animals.
