1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,636
The order failed. Part of me was still holding out hope

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,404
that they could fix things, but guess I should have known

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:08,000
better.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're really not making me feel better, Reuben.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,307
Oh, you want help, do you? That's what I said, isn't it?

6
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:21,000
Just as you once helped us before.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,430
This isn't about the past, it's about the future. There are

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,000
three of those things now.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You say that like it's my fault! It is your fault!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,391
Take responsibility for once, Soren. Soren, you need to

11
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,000
listen to me.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hush, Ivor, for once!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,123
I told you, I wouldn't have followed you here without good

14
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:40,192
reason. What you don't understand is, you are all in very

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,000
grave danger.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously!

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,686
No, I mean specifically this group. The Winter Storm isn't

18
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:51,000
acting randomly, it's following Gabriel.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see, I may have programmed it to follow his amulet.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have the amulet, Ivor, I have all along.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,785
What? Ivor, you fool! You've created a monster that's

22
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:05,000
following Jesse!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I... I didn't know.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's only getting stronger!

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,103
You don't think I realize that? Nothing can stop those

26
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:14,000
things! Nothing even hurts them!

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,410
Well, except Enderman. We actually just saw a bunch of

28
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,000
Endermen pull blocks off a wither storm.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,282
So, enough of them working together might be able to

30
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:28,000
destroy a wither storm entirely.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,253
The question is, how to bring the storms and the Endermen

32
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:33,000
together?

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Endermen aren't pets, they don't follow orders.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At least, not from mere mortals.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, they're just animals.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're just animals.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They're just animals.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They're just animals.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They're just animals.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're just animals.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're just animals.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're just animals.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They're just animals.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They're just animals.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They're just animals.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They're just animals.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They're just animals.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They're just animals.
