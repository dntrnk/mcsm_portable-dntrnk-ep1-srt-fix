00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Just give her some space. She may still come out of it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What if she doesn't? What if it's permanent?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Jesse, this is awful.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You, Jesse. You're the one who rescued me. Tell me, please, what is going on?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You were caught in the wither storm for a long time, Petra.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Really? I can't remember any of it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The room... everything's spinning.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's okay. Easy does it.
