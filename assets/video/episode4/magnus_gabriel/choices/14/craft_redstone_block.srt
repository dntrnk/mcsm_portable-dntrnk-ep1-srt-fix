00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Okay, a redstone block.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Okay, let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to go and place these pistons.

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,020
Holy cow, we did it!

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,020
I'm proud of you, Olivia.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,520
Thanks, Jesse.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,520
And thanks for everything you said just before.

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
It really helped.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
No problemo.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
This way! This way!

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Run!

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Everybody get on! Quick, onto the barge!

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
That was close. Everyone okay?

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
For the moment.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Slime!

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,520
I'm remembering something with slime... and chickens.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Or maybe they were ducks?

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,520
There was a big gathering of people.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
And we were looking for a man with a sword.

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Thanks for watching!
