1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, at least we're back together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes! The dream team reunited!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now the dream team's just got to find a way across this gaping bottomless pit.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What about this thing? Could it get us across?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's some kind of flying barge.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It would probably get us to the other side, but it's in really bad shape.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And it's really complicated.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can fix it though, right?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know. I think it's out of my league.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come on, you'll figure it out. You know you always do.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This layout doesn't even make any sense. What was I ever thinking?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or maybe it's just me. I mean, Ellegard herself said I don't have what it takes to be a great engineer.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So prove her wrong. Show the world what you're made of.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Prove her wrong? Jesse, she's the greatest redstone engineer ever.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She's in the Order of the Stone.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sure, but the Order are still people, just like us.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Right. Just like us. I mean, how are we the ones saving the world when even they don't have what it takes?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Soren and Ivor are always at each other's throats. None of them give Ellegard any respect.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And Magnus lost his life trying to fight this.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If the Order can't do this, how are we supposed to?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All I know is the world is depending on us.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And maybe the world is in trouble. I mean, they defeated an Ender Dragon. Can you name even one thing we've done right?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I don't mean managing to stay alive.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Something that actually matters.
