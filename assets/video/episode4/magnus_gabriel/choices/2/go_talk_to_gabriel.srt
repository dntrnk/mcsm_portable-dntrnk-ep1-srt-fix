1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You feeling any better, Gabriel?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,225
Better is relative. The battle with the Witherstorm sapped

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,000
the last of my strength. Considerable though it was.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You need to rest.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're right, I do.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,850
Look, Jesse, wherever you decide to go after this cave,

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,000
give him some time to get his strength back.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Problem is we don't have time.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Jesse's right. In fact, it might be best if my journey ends

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,000
here. This cave is safe, easy to defend.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,866
If that's what you feel is best, then I support it. You've

12
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,000
been through too much as it is.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,682
Thank you, Jesse. I'm just sorry that I can't be there for

14
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:47,000
you.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Me too.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,885
Nothing had to turn out like this. If the order had just

17
00:00:54,885 --> 00:01:00,033
been different, if we'd made smarter choices, Iver wouldn't

18
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,000
have turned into a maniac and...

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, maybe Magnus would still be alive.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's just let bygones be bygones.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,080
But how can we not? So many lives torn asunder. The world

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,000
ripped to pieces.
