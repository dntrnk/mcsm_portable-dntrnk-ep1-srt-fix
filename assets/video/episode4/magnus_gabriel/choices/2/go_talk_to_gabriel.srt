1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You feeling any better, Gabriel?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Better is relative. The battle with the Witherstorm sapped the last of my strength. Considerable though it was.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You need to rest.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're right, I do.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Look, Jesse, wherever you decide to go after this cave, give him some time to get his strength back.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Problem is we don't have time.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Jesse's right. In fact, it might be best if my journey ends here. This cave is safe, easy to defend.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If that's what you feel is best, then I support it. You've been through too much as it is.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you, Jesse. I'm just sorry that I can't be there for you.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Me too.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Nothing had to turn out like this. If the order had just been different, if we'd made smarter choices, Iver wouldn't have turned into a maniac and...

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, maybe Magnus would still be alive.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's just let bygones be bygones.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But how can we not? So many lives torn asunder. The world ripped to pieces.
