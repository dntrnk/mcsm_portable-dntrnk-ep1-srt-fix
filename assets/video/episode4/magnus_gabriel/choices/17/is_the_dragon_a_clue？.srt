1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're missing something here, Sorin.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,500
And I have a feeling the key might be locked in that head of yours.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,000
I have a key locked in my head?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What I'm saying is, I think you need to tell me about the Ender Dragon battle.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh! Ha, if only you'd been there.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It was a fight for the ages.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But even so, the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had imagined.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I realized that it was drawing strength from the Ender Crystals, and that the Crystals had to be destroyed.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow, the second I destroyed by launching myself on the shockwave of Magnus' TNT.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Using only my strength and my wiles, I steered the foul beast toward the third crystal.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I flew the dragon directly toward the final crystal.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We became heroes, and eventually, legends.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The greatest the world has ever known.
