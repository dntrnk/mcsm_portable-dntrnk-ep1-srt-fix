1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
And these are supposed to be the Ender crystals?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,240
Scale models of them. They were the secret to the dragon's demise.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
A secret, huh?

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,000
Ha, if only you'd been there. It was a fight for the ages.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,760
We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,760
But even so, the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had imagined.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:35,520
I realized that it was drawing strength from the Ender crystals, and that the crystals had to be destroyed.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,520
I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow, the second I destroyed by launching myself on the shockwave of Magnus' TNT.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Using only my strength and my wiles, I steered the foul beast toward the third crystal.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I flew the dragon directly toward the final crystal.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,280
We became heroes, and eventually, legends.

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
The greatest the world has ever known.
