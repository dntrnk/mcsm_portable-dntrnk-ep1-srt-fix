1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Look, there were two of you caught in the tractor beam that day and...

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,400
Well, I helped Gabriel.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,500
The sick guy over there.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,900
Oh...

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,600
Yeah, I think I do remember that.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,900
You gotta realize I thought we needed him if it was just about who I liked!

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,500
No, I get it.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
You did what you had to do.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,300
All that matters is you're with us now.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,100
And that you're still a fighter.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
The best one I know.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,300
So, what do you say? Will you be part of our group again?

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,900
Alright. Count me in.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,600
We didn't all make it back, though.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Guys, it was my fault.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,600
I'm the one who took Magnus' armor.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,600
She's right. You can't blame yourself, Jesse.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
Being emotional is getting us nowhere!

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,400
What I want to know is what happened out there today.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,700
Why is that thing still alive?

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,300
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,000
I mean, it ripped the Witherstorm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block.

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
So the command block is still out there?

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh, great!

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,100
Look, our plan didn't work, so we obviously need a new one.

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,700
The question is, what do we do?

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,200
Well, why are you asking me?

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,300
Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,100
I need a moment to think.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Is he always like this?

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,700
You have no idea.

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,600
That jacket, it looks familiar.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
Lucas always wears that jacket.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,900
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown from that dead monster.

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,100
Even thinking about it hurts.

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Hey, hey, it's okay.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,300
Jesse, if what Petra said is true...

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,400
I mean, do you think?

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,200
I thought for sure they were gone, but if they were just trapped in the Witherstorm...
