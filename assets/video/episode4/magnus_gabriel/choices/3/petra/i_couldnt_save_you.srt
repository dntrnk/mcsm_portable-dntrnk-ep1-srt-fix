1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
I couldn't save you things were happening so fast and that thing was powerful

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
Well, thank you for trying

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,640
Sure all that matters is you're with us now and that you're still a fighter the best one I know

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,280
So, what do you say? Will you be part of our group again?

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,660
All right count me in we didn't all make it back though

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guys it was my fault

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm the one who took Magnus's armor

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But you couldn't have known what was going to happen

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She's right. You can't blame yourself. Jesse. I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Being emotional is getting us nowhere. What I want to know is what happened out there today. Why is that thing still alive?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Formidabomb just wasn't strong enough

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I mean it ripped the wither storm apart, but it didn't make a dent in the command block

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the command block is still out there? Oh great

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Look our plan didn't work. So we obviously need a new one

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Question is what do we do?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why are you asking me? Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, why are you asking me am I expected to know every last thing in the universe?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I need a moment to think

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is he always like this you have no idea

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Jacket it looks familiar

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lucas always wears that jacket

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, I saw other people wearing it when I was being thrown from that dead monster

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Even thinking about it hurts. Hey, hey, it's okay

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Jesse if what Petra said is true. I mean, do you think I?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thought for sure they were gone. But if they were just tracked in the wither storm

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You
