1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
We know for a fact that Witherstorm will follow the Amulet.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,133
So if we take the Amulet back to your fortress where the

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,040
Endermen are...

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
We'll lead them straight into a massive trap!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Just one problem. You're forgetting about the Command Block.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,813
Ugh, yes. It's clear now that no weapon can destroy it. Not

7
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,640
even a Formita Bomb.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,200
Yes, well, I created a failsafe.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
What kind of failsafe, exactly?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,433
An enchanting book. One that contains the power of the

11
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,240
Command Block itself.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,078
Use it to enchant a weapon, and you'll be able to smash the

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,160
Command Block to bits. Forever!

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,280
Yes. Yes, that's it!

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Ivar? Well, I'll be. It is you.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,280
A pleasure, as always, Elagard. It just keeps coming for us.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,673
Guys, there's a reason it's been following us. Ivar says

18
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:57,280
it's because of the Amulet that Gabriel...

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
The point is, we need to get moving.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Ivar says it's because of the Amulet that Gabriel...

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,302
The point is, we need to get moving. We aren't safe. Not as

26
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,280
long as we have that Amulet.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,292
I'll take it. I'll keep the Witherstorms busy. You guys do

28
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,280
what you gotta do.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Axel, thank you.

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
You just go make that super weapon. I'll meet you back at

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,280
Soren's Fortress.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,962
Well, Axel shouldn't have to do this alone. I'm going with

33
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:29,280
him.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
I appreciate that.

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,763
Well, I want to go with Jesse. That feels like where I

36
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:35,280
belong.

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Everyone, take good care of yourselves.

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,673
Hey, Jesse. Let's try our handshake again, just once for

39
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:45,280
the road.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
You
