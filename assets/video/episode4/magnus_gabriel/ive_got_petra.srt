1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
I've got Petra!

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,560
Then I'll take Gabriel!

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,360
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,440
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,120
Whatever you do, don't look back!

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Ah! I look!

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
Watch out!

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,600
It's gaining on us!

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
It's coming after us!

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920
Kick-locker!

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Make it stop, please!

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Doing the best I can.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,280
Jesse, look out!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to get you!

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,600
Have I seen Enderman attack a weatherstorm?

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
Enderman move blocks. It's what they do.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
There! We can hide over there!

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,720
Guys, come on!

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
We've got to build a new one, like right now.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Come on, faster!

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
I saw your screaming in my ear!

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Sorry.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
We made it! We actually freaking made it!

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Hey, how are you feeling?

25
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
I don't really feel like myself.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
I still can't believe you're even alive.

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Do you not recognize us?

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm Axel. This is Olivia.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
We've been friends for a really long time.

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
We've been friends for a really long time.
