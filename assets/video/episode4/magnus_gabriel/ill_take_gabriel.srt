1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
I'll take Gabriel.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,800
Then I've got Petra.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,600
Hold on, this might be a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,300
Come on, horses!

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,900
Whatever you do, don't look back.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,700
Ah!

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
I look.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,600
Watch out!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's gaining on us!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Pick up the pace or we're all done for!

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
First time on a horse here!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can't find the horsemanship, Jesse.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,300
Is that what this is called?

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Jesse, look out!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to get you!

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Am I seeing Enderman attack the weatherstorm?

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
Enderman move locks, it's what they do!

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,000
There! We can get him!

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Ah!

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We can be rich.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Guys, come on!

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
We've got to build a new one, like right now.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Come on, faster!

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Yee-haw!

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Woo!

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
I saw you screaming in my ear.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Sorry.

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
We made it!

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
We actually freaking made it!

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey, how are you feeling?

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
I'm fine.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm fine.

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm fine.

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm fine.

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm fine.

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm fine.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm fine.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm fine.

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm fine.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't really feel like myself.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I still can't believe you're even alive.

42
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you not recognize us?

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm Axel.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000
This is Olivia.

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
We've been friends for a really long time.

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,000
We've been friends for a really long time.
