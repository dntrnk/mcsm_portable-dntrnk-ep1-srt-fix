1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Everything in the universe starts out as just a block.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What comes of those blocks is up to those who wield them.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our friends have traveled far and wide in search of the Order of the Stone

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and a way to stop the wither storm for good.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But even well-laid plans can go awry.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The threat to this world, to its very existence, is far from over.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Go!

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Where... where am I? What's happening?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Come on, I'm gonna get you out of here.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do I... know you?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Jassby, Jassby, where are you?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're coming!

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No way, no way!

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Get up, Petra.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who is Petra?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm gonna get you out of here.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This way!

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Jassby, you made it!

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Petra?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're missing friend.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Look out!

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Those Endermen are running the wrong way! They'll be killed!

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Soren, what do you think you're doing?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These Endermen are running directly into danger.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're putting us in danger every second you just stand there.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jassby! They're falling behind!

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Axel, you gotta move faster!

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's too sick. That's the best we can do.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They're not gonna be able to outrun him. Not on foot!

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We just need to get them moving faster.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Bingo!

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Everybody, get on!

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Go!

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wait, what about us?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Come on, Jassby, we got this!

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll take the reins, and they can just hang on.
