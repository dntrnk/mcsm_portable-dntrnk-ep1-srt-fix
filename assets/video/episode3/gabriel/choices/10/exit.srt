00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,488
Hang on a second. Soren in disguise looks like any old

2
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:08,640
Enderman, and so will you. How

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,913
are you going to find him? Walk up to every Enderman out

4
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:13,960
there and say, hey, are you Soren?

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,315
We just need to get his attention without rallying up the

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,080
Enderman.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,742
Try not to die, okay? I'd really hate to have to watch that

8
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:24,480
from behind this protective

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,000
glass. Thanks for the photo confidence.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,859
Okay, we just got to get Soren's attention and avoid

11
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,000
attracting theirs.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,911
Looks like a building grid. I have no idea what I'm

13
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:49,760
supposed to do with it though.

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Cracked it yet? Not yet, but I'm getting closer.
