1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,066
I need six blocks to finish that shape in Soren's

2
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:16,800
instructions.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
This guy's got the only block around.

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Let's take a little look at the instructions.

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Nothing I can't handle.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:12,800
False evidence of Enderman intelligence accomplished.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Nothing to see here guys. Just walk away.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I am sorry about this but it has to look real.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I don't think it'll bruise.

10
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
These suits were built with durability in mind.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
You must be Soren.

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I am, but must I be?

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Why did you hit me?

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
There were strategic reasons and a personal one.

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
You are trespassing after all.

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
You hit me hard in the face.

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,800
You upset the Enderman and I got you to safety.

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
By the way, as far as introductions are concerned,

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
this is not going very well.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
We're in danger.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
What else is new?

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Whatever your issue is, whatever your problem,

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,800
it has occurred before and has been solved before.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Even so, what do you need me for?

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I've gone out of my way to avoid these types of problems.

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
I don't even remember what it looks like up there.
