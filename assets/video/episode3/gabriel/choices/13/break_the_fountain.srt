1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's break that fountain.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,835
Back in the maze, when we fell into the water, the Enderman

3
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:05,700
didn't follow us.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,300
Well, naturally. Enderman hate water.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, if we could force the fountain to overflow somehow...

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Jesse, you still have the Enderman suit.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,926
Put that on, and you'll be able to safely reach the

8
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:20,500
fountain.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,469
Ugh. Just when I thought I'd never have to smell this thing

10
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,000
again.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good luck, dude.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll, uh, all watch from here, then.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Where it's safe.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Phew. Try not to die.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Aah!

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, everybody, let's go.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's the holdup?

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ugh.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They're everywhere.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How are we supposed to get through this?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean, physically and psychologically.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Say we somehow make it.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can't see how this won't become a reoccurring nightmare.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure what's going on here.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know.
