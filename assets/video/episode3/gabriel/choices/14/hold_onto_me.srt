1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Everyone, just hold on to me. I'll guide us through them.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,717
I guess if this is the only way we're gonna make it back to

3
00:00:05,717 --> 00:00:06,500
the trap door...

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Maybe we should, uh, turn around... or not.

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:44,500
This guy's right in my base.

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:01:00,100
Oh, when I constructed this place, I worried about how

7
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:10,500
flammable my building material was,

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,891
so I installed a fire suppression system to prevent the

9
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,500
whole thing from going up in flames.

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
So there's more water?

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,258
Much more. If we activate it, it could disperse all these

12
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,500
endermen while we swim to safety.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Can we reach the controls from here?

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:39,500
The lever. It's right up there.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Yeesh.

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,527
I don't know how much water this thing is gonna kick out,

17
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,500
so everybody...

18
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
It's working!

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Well done, Jesse. Now, time to swim to that trap door.

20
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:53,500
We made it.

21
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Making it is relative.

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Oh, come on!

23
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,933
Not that this isn't a ton of fun, but grab that permitted

24
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,500
bomb and get out of here!

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
One small problem.

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Tiny?

27
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Really?

28
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Let's get off even.

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I haven't actually built it yet.

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
That's a small problem?

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,921
You seem like a person who appreciates cool stuff that's

32
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,500
cool for no reason.

33
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Thanks?

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Go ahead and throw that lever behind you.

35
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Hold on to your socks, or they're about to get blown off.

36
00:03:43,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Go to work, boys.

37
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Ouch.

38
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Yikes.
