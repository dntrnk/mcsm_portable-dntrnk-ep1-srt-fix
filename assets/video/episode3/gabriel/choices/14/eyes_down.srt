1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Keep your eyes down, everyone. Grab on to me.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,439
I guess if this is the only way we're gonna make it back to

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,200
the trap door...

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Maybe we should, uh, turn around. Or not.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:43,200
This guy's right in my face.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:59,800
Oh, when I constructed this place, I worried about how

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:10,200
flammable my building material was,

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,591
so I installed a fire suppression system to prevent the

9
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,200
whole thing from going up in flames.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
So there's more water?

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,958
Much more. If we activate it, it could disperse all these

12
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,200
endermen while we swim to safety.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Can we reach the controls from here?

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:39,200
The lever. It's right up there.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Yeesh.

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,227
I don't know how much water this thing is gonna kick out,

17
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:57,200
so everybody...

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,200
It's working!

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Well done, Jesse. Now, time to swim to that trap door.

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:53,200
We made it.

21
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Making it is relative.

22
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh, come on.

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,260
Not that this isn't a ton of fun, but grab that permitted

24
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,200
bomb and get out of here.

25
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
One small problem.

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Tiny.

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Really?

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Let's go.

29
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
I haven't actually built it yet.

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
That's a small problem.

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:21,409
You seem like a person who appreciates cool stuff that's

32
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:28,200
cool for no reasonigung.

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Thanks?

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Go ahead and throw that lever behind you.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,119
Hold on to your socks, because they're about to get blown

36
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:31,200
off.

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Go to work, boys.

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm gonna go get the lever.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Yikes.
