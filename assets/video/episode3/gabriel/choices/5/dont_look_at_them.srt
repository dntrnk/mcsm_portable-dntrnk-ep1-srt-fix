1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Call it whatever you want. As long as we don't look at

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,000
them, we'll be fine.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,655
We might want to hold off on the grammar lessons until

5
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:08,000
later.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Which way are we headed, Jesse?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The amulet does not work in the end.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ha ha! Ah, great!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Whew! Man, so we were trapped, and now we're lost.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
At least we're alive, and well.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We just have to keep on trucking till we get to Soren.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Face it, Jesse. We might never find this guy.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There he is.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,454
That has to be Soren. Who else would build a staircase in

16
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:45,000
the end?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We gotta go.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Everyone, behind me! I'll handle the Intimate.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's not a good idea.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Jesse's right.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, you know what? I'll just go.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Give me a chance.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Just say the word, and I'll do it.
