1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's a haunting of Enderman.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,355
We might want to hold off on the grammar lessons until

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:05,700
later.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,400
Which way are we headed, Jesse?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
The amulet does not work in the end.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,900
Great.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,100
Man, so we were trapped, and now we're lost.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,700
At least we're alive and well.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,700
Yeah.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,000
We just have to keep on trucking till we get to Soren.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Face it, Jesse.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,500
We might never find this guy.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,700
There he is.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,400
That has to be Soren.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,500
Who else would build a staircase in the end?

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,100
We gotta go.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,100
Everyone, behind me!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,200
I'll handle the Internet.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
It's not a good idea.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,500
Jesse's right.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,900
Actually, you know what?

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,900
I'll just go.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Give me a chance.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
Just say the word.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
And I'll do it.
