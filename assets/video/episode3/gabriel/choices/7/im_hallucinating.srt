1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
I think I must be seeing things

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,087
It's like another world up here a brand new totally

3
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:11,660
unspoiled world so bright

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,600
That's my body axle my broken battered body

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
second

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,715
What in the it's made of wool this tree the grass it's it's

7
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:40,600
all wool

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,655
You're telling me that we've been resting all our hopes on

9
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:44,880
this guy and the whole time

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,374
He's been building some totally artificial happy land could

11
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:49,500
it be that he just

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,720
missed home

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,780
If you miss home you go and visit you don't build an exact

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,160
replica. We came here for nothing

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,135
We came here for Sorin and for his for mita bomb. That's

16
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:05,200
still the plan

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,280
Just look around Jesse if the greatest builder of all time

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,400
has spent years working on this

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,796
What are the chances he's even gonna have that bomb? Huh?

20
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:16,560
I've had enough crazy for one day

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,480
Is he gonna be okay just give him some space he'll be okay

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,280
So I'm probably looking for

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,744
Looking for a secret door and the secret mechanism to open

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,480
said door

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
You
