1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Don't touch my pig.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,360
Oh, maybe he's his own pig, Jesse.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,760
You ever thought of that?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,920
You heard what I said.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,200
Jesse?

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,040
What?

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,160
The amulet.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,760
Soren must be close.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
Uh, huh, where'd he go?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,840
You have got to be kidding me.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,040
Sounds like the grinder is backed up.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,000
With loot?

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,480
Go, go, go, go, go!

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Go!

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,660
Whoa!

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,760
Keep moving!

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960
Axel, look out!

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,460
Ah!

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,160
Take that, ugly!

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Oh, you want some too?

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm coming, buddy!

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,800
I have had enough of this!

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Take that!

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,680
Your face, spider!

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
There's two things I hate.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
It's running and monsters.

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,320
Any portal?

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,480
That's the way out.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,980
Wait!

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,080
What?

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,580
Look!

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Oh no!

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,480
Gabriel!

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,400
Get away from them!

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
In your face, monsters!

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,640
Here we go!

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Jump!

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,180
Whoa!

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,400
Oh, great!

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,880
Just keeps getting better.

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,600
Where's Axel?

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
He was right behind me.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,780
You!

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,640
I swear, I'm not trying to do that.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
Get off!

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Oh, geez.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,120
Are you hurt?

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,420
What?

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
No, I'm not crying.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,880
Just look!

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,340
Hurry!

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,540
I hate this.

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,900
So, uh, what do we call that?

55
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,980
A herd of Endermen?

56
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,860
A flock of Endermen?

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,060
A swarm?
