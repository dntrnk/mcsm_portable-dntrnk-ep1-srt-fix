1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, thanks for grabbing that.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Not a problem.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Hang on a minute.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,800
He's close.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,700
Soren's close by.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,000
He's gotta be... this way.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Look how bright it is.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
Sounds like the grinder is packed up.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,300
With loot?

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,100
Go, go, go, go, go!

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,100
Wee, wee, wee, wee!

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Whoa!

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Keep moving!

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
Axel, look out!

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Ah!

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Keep that, aren't we?

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100
Oh, you want some too?

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,100
I'm coming, buddy!

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,100
I have had some of this!

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Take that!

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
In your face, spider!

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,100
There's two things I hate.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,100
It's running and monsters.

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Can you pull it off?

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
That's the way out.

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Wait!

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
What?

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Look!

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,100
Oh no!

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Gabriel!

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,100
Get away from them!

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
Yah!

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
Yah!

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,100
In your face, monsters!

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
Here we go!

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Jump!

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
Whoa!

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Oh, great!

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Just keeps getting better.

41
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Where's Axel?

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
He was right behind me.

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
Ooh!

44
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
Ha!

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
See?

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,100
I told you I'd pay you back.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Get off!

48
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,100
Oh, geez.

49
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Are you hurt?

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
What?

51
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
No, I'm not crying.

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Just look!

53
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
So, what do we call that?

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
A herd of Endermen?

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
A flock of Endermen?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
A swarm?
