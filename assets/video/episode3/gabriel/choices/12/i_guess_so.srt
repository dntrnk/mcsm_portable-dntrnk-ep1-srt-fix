1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Sure.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,880
That's the best thing I've heard in years.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,300
Admittedly, it's not a very high bar.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,320
Don't worry. I'm going to help you, because that's what

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,180
friends do.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,020
Before we leave, I'm going to give my old friends a gift.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,600
A gift of song.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,440
What's happening?

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
Oh.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,400
Gary may seem scary, but he's a swell guy.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,520
Sally Dilly Dally's, give her credit she tries

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,820
They might look the same to the untrained eye

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,820
But that's a lie, so I say

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,500
Wait, is that... Are you...

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,960
Soren'.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Whoa.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Hey.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
You look terrible.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Terribly handsome.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,920
Hello, old friend.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We've been looking for you.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Look away.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
You upset them.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,380
You altered their behavior.

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,460
Okay, let's go.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,680
And the heads just keep on coming.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,560
I wasn't expecting so many house guests.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,580
There's no way I have enough seashell subs for all of them.

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,460
How are we supposed to get out of here?

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,340
We need to come up with a plan.

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,129
And not our usual we'll come up with a plan when we have

32
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:00,420
to...

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh, wait, now we have to kind of plan.
