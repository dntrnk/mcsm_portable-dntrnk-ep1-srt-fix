1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,950
If we stick together we can do anything even something that

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,800
feels impossible

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,951
It just feels extra impossible now, then we stick together

4
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:09,860
extra hard

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,025
Okay, I kind of wish Gabriel would tell everybody it would

6
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,840
just make things easier

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,100
I kind of need to get at that lever you're blocking

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think I found the way out

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Thanks, yep

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
That's weird

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,880
Hey everyone, I think I found soren's way out

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,880
No, I'm fine if I wasn't fine could I do this

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,440
We'll see what we can find in the rest of the house

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,546
Just hope we don't discover soren as he's getting ready for

16
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:21,760
bed

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
He's wore the most

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
revealing bathrobes

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's see what's going on behind this door

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
It's just a recording

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,900
After all that he's not even here

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
We came all this way and for what

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
We're no closer to soren than before
