1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,993
It just means you gotta step up more than you have already,

2
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:04,400
okay?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Okay.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
I kinda wish Gabriel would tell everybody.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,200
It would just make things... easier.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,100
I kinda need to get at that lever you're blocking.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Really?

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Thanks. Yep.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000
That's... weird.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Hey everyone, I think I found Soren's way out!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh no, I'm fine. If I wasn't fine, could I do this?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We'll see what we can find in the rest of the house.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,454
I just hope we don't discover Soren as he's getting ready

14
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:19,000
for bed.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,500
He always wore the most... revealing bathrobes.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's see what's going on behind this door.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's see what's going on behind this door.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I call that one Symphony in E.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A new composition to celebrate my newest discovery.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To celebrate my newest discovery!

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's him!

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In time, I observed one other block on top of another block.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What the?

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just a recording.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A time of undeniable intelligence.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
I hope I'm not imagining things.

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
After all that, he's not even here?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I better eat something.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We came all this way and for what?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're no closer to Soren than before.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
