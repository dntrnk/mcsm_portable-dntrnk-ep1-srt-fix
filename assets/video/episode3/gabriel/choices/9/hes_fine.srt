00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Gabriel can take care of himself. You just worry about you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,638
You're hiding something. And by not telling me the truth,

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:10,000
you are putting all of us in danger.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,275
Why don't you go back to looking for Soren? I know you're

5
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,000
sick of talking to me.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I kinda need to get at that lever you're blocking.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Fine.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That wasn't too hard, was it?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,428
Walking one foot to the left? Nope. I think I got that

10
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:38,000
covered.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's... weird.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey everyone, I think I found Soren's way out!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh no, I'm fine. If I wasn't fine, could I do this?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll see what we can find in the rest of the house.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,454
I just hope we don't discover Soren as he's getting ready

16
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,000
for bed.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He always wore the most revealing bathrobes.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's see what's going on behind this door.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I call that one Symphony in E.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A new composition to celebrate my newest discovery!

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm so excited!

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm so excited!

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm so excited!

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm so excited!

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm so excited!

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm so excited!

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm so excited!

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Discovery! That's him!

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Soren!

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What the... It's just a recording.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
...undeniable intelligence. I hope I'm not imagining things.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
After all that, he's not even here?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I better eat something.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We came all this way and for what?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're no closer to Soren than before.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm so excited!

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm so excited!

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm so excited!
