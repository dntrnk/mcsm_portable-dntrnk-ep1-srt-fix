1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Are you gonna help us take on the winter storm?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,360
Ha! Help you? You're gonna help me!

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,000
Uh, we've been fighting this entire time!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ah!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Uh, what's going on?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Ah!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You don't have to worry about the monsters!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They're running away!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Worry about what they're running away from.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I feel like that got bigger.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It did.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's verminabomb time.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Zoran?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's him! It's you!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello, old friends.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's time to go.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We only get one shot at this.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Remember, once the verminabomb is crafted,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it'll explode in a matter of seconds.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,365
It means whoever is doing the crafting will be in great

22
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:08,000
danger.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to go get Zoran.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to go get Zoran.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to go get Zoran.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Whoever is doing the crafting will be in great danger.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was hoping, well, perhaps we could draw straws.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to set off the verminabomb.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's what I was hoping for.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The rest of us will build distractions in its path.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The rest of us will build distractions in its path.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hopefully it will buy you some time.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Jesse, take my armor. It will help.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Nah, you can take mine.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's gotten me out of a lot of jams.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I insist.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I double insist.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I triple insist.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I insist four times.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Quadruple!

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I insist four times.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Know it all.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've never found that insulting.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I bet you don't know what the fifth one is though.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Quintuple.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alternatively, pentuple.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Up to you, Jesse.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Real armor or nerd armor.
