1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Right on, Jesse!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Uh, by the power vested in me, yadda-da-yadda-da-da,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the Order of the Stone!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,393
Jesse, you're going to have to set down a crafting table

6
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:15,000
out there

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and make that for Midabob.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Everyone else, grab a buddy and split up.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,373
We need to keep that wither storm on track, so build,

10
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,000
build, build!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Jesse, don't forget, super TNT in the middle

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and gunpowder all around!

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I hope this works!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go, go, go!

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Not yet!

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Got it.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Please don't blow up.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Watch out!

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No!

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Magnus!

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Eat this!

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah!

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah!

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is that it?

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is it over?

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't believe it's actually dead.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You did it, Jesse! You actually did it!

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not that I'm saying I doubted you, but I did a little.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But now I don't, and I never will again.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Look, I know it wasn't easy, but...

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
About time we got a real wed.
