1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I couldn't have done this without you guys. Any of it.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,200
Oh, believe me, we're well aware.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
Thanks for saying it, though.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Thanks, buddy.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey, not to put a damper on the party, but...

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,600
anyone seen Soren or Ellegard?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, no.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You fought valiantly, my friend.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
You and I...

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
both know...

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,800
my fight...

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,300
is over.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,100
Stuff and nonsense, stuff and nonsense.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
Save your strength, Ellegard.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,400
We'll take care of this.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,100
We'll take care of you.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,400
Oh...

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,500
Jesse...

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,200
Ellegard.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,800
My armor...

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
really suits you, Jesse.

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,800
I want you to keep it.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Okay?

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,100
It's...

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,800
certainly not going to be...

26
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,000
much use to me now.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,100
Don't say such things.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,900
Jesse knows.

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,100
I'm right.
