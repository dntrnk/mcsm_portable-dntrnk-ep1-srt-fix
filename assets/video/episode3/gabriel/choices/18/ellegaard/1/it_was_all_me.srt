1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I did do it, didn't I?

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Thanks, buddy.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,040
Hey, not to put a damper on the party, but...

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,620
...anyone seen Soren or Ellegard?

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,120
Oh, no.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,120
You fought valiantly, my friend.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,920
You and I...

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,520
...both know...

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,120
...my fight...

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
...is over.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,120
Stuff and nonsense. Stuff and nonsense.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,120
Save your strength, Ellegard.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,520
We'll take care of this.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,320
We'll take care of you.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,720
Oh, Jesse.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,320
Ellegard.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,320
You're not alone.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
You're not alone.

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Jesse.

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
Ellegard.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,920
My armor...

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,120
...really suits you, Jesse.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,120
I want you to keep it.

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Okay?

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,120
It's...

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,920
...certainly not going to be...

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,120
...much use to me now.

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Don't say such things.

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,020
Jesse knows...

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,220
...I'm right.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Thanks for watching!
