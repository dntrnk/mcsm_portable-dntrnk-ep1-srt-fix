1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Help me save the world.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
How?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Formidabom.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,661
There's a wither storm on the loose and it's eating the

5
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,000
world.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ah, I see. You misspoke.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You don't need me. You need my stuff.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,257
I've found that when you give people what they want, they

9
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:28,000
turn on you.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who turned on you?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All of them!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,782
It's why I prefer Endermen. They always do what you expect,

13
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:37,000
almost to a fault.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have the amulet.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Gabriel gave it to me.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Gabriel?

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Gabriel asked me to reassemble the Order of the Stone.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The Order of the Stone? They asked for me?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Gabriel is your friend.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hmm, I don't know. Does he ever talk about me?

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Uh, sure.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What kinds of things do they say?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That you were missed.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Really?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,548
Maybe it was more missing. You have to read between the

27
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:06,000
lines.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, yes you do.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But what about you? Are you my friend?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As long as we're on the subject?

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Not to put you on the spot?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.
