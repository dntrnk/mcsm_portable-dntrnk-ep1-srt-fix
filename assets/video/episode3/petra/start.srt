1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,689
It is said that within every loss, every challenge, and

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,000
every failure, there is a gift.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,598
And when our band of unlikely adventurers are tasked with

4
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:14,240
saving the world from the

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,445
coming storm, they will bring together the bravest and the

6
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,040
brightest to stop it.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,874
But finding the last and most elusive member of the Order

8
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,960
of the Stone and his legendary

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Formidebomb would prove their most perilous mission yet.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,229
For some would rather our heroes' story end here, shutting

11
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,000
the door on their adventurer forever.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,419
But like all doors, when one closes, another is bound to

13
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:44,000
open.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Stop him!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You won't get away with this.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Watch it!

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everyone okay?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I felt all of that.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That was one heck of a landing, Axel.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He mostly used his face.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We need to find Soren.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I still can't figure out how Ivor made the door close.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe we should focus more on how it opens.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's basically what I said.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you okay?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why are you asking me that?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Just checking up on you.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Everything's fine. All of it.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Are you okay?

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait, are you...

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you...

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you okay?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Look at this.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,486
I'm not trying to freak you out, but I'm a little bit

36
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,000
freaked out right now.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's starting to feel stiff.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And my vision's all jittery.
