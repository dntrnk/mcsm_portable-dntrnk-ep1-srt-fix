1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Right on, Jesse!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Uh, by the power vested in me, yadda-da-yadda-da-da,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the Order of the Stone!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,393
Jesse, you're going to have to set down a crafting table

6
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:15,000
out there

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and make that for Midabob.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Everyone else, grab a buddy and split up.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,373
We need to keep that wither storm on track, so build,

10
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,000
build, build!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Jesse, don't forget, super TNT in the middle

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and gunpowder all around!

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I hope this works!

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No, no, no!

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Not yet!

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Got it.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Please don't blow up.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Watch out!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No!

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No!

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No!

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No!

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No!

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No!

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No!

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No!

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No!

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No!

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Watch out!

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No!

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No!

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Madness!

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Eat this!

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that it?

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Is it over?

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't believe it's actually dead!

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You did it, Jesse!

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You actually did it!

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You did it!

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You actually did it!

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You actually did it!

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You actually did it!

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You actually did it!

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You actually did it!

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You did it, Jesse!

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You actually did it!

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not that I'm saying I doubted you, but I did a little.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But now I don't, and I never will again.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Look, I know it wasn't easy, but...

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
About time we got a real win.
