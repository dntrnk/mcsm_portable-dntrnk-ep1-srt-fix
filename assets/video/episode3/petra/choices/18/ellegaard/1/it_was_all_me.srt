1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I did do it, didn't I?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thanks, buddy.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, not to put a damper on the party, but...

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
...anyone seen Soren or Ellegard?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, no.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You fought valiantly, my friend.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You and I...

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
...both know...

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
...my fight...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
...is over.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Stuff and nonsense.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Stuff and nonsense.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Save your strength, Ellegard.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll take care of this.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll take care of you.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, Jesse.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Ellegard.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're not alone.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, Jesse.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Ellegard.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My armor...

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
...really suits you, Jesse.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want you to keep it.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's certainly not going to be...

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
...much use to me now.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't say such things.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Jesse knows I'm right.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thanks for watching!
