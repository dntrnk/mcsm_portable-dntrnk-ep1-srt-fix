1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Jesse, you deserve this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What you're doing means we're all gonna die!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,916
Jesse, you're going to have to set down a crafting table

5
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,000
out there and make that from it-a-bomb.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Everyone else, grab a buddy and split up.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,164
We need to keep that wither storm on track, so build,

8
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:20,000
build, build!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Jesse, don't forget, super TNT in the middle!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And gunpowder all around!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I hope this works!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go, go, go!

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Not yet!

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Got it!

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please don't blow up.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Watch out!

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No!

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Aligarh!

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Eat this!

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh yeah!

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is that it?

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is it over?

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't believe it's actually dead!

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You did it, Jesse! You actually did it!

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ha ha! Handled like a champ!

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I knew it wasn't easy, but...

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:29,000
About time we got a real win.
