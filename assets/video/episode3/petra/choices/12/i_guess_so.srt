1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Sure.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's the best thing I've heard in years.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Admittedly, it's not a very high bar.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,104
Don't worry. I'm going to help you, because that's what

5
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:11,000
friends do.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Before we leave, I'm going to give my old friends a gift.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A gift of song.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's happening?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Gary may seem scary, but he's a swell guy.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sally Dilly Dallys, give her credit she tries.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They might look the same to the untrained eye.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But that's a lie, so I say...

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wait, is that... are you...?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Soren.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Whoa.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Nice to meet you, Soren.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You look... terrible.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Look away!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You've upset them!

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You've altered their behavior!

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, let's go.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And the hits just keep on coming.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Huh?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wasn't expecting so many house guests.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's no way I have enough seashell subs for all of them.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How are we supposed to get out of here?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We need to come up with a plan.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,894
And not our usual

29
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:47,210
will-come-up-with-a-plan-when-we-have-to-oh-wait-now-we-have-to

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,000
kind of plan.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We need to come up with a plan.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,536
And not our usual

33
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:52,526
will-come-up-with-a-plan-when-we-have-to-oh-wait-now-we-have-to

34
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:53,000
kind of plan.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, wait, now we have to kind of plan!
