1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Not really.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Uh, I get it. A joke. Between friends.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That is so classic. You.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,909
Don't worry. I'm going to help you because that's what

5
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,000
friends do.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Before we leave, I'm going to give my old friends a gift.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A gift of song.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's happening?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,096
Gary may seem scary, but he's a swell guy. Sally dilly

10
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:33,000
dallys.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,767
Give her credit she tries. They might look the same to the

12
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,000
untrained eye.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But that's a lie. So I say...

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait, is that...are you...

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Soren.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Whoa.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice to meet you, Soren.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You look...terrible.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Look away!

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You upset them. You altered their behavior.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, let's go.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And the hits just keep on coming.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Huh? I wasn't expecting so many house gases.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There's no way I have enough seashell subs for all of them.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How are we supposed to get out of here?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We need to come up with a plan.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,704
And not our usual will come up with a plan when we have

28
00:01:58,704 --> 00:01:59,000
to...

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, wait, now we have to kind of plan.
