1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hey, Soren?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Jesse!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Think I've got almost enough gunpowder now.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,400
Glad to hear it.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,074
And Jesse, I am sorry for not keeping this place as

6
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,280
organized as I should.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,680
It's very embarrassing.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,800
And this is my super TNT.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's build us a Formidabomb.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,680
Yes, let's build away.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,440
Uh, how do we build us a Formidabomb, exactly?

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,960
Do we just combine this with gunpowder?

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,400
Well, the crafting recipe is quite simple, really.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,080
Super TNT in the middle and gunpowder all around.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Got it.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
No, no, no, no.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,565
The ingredients are highly unstable, even putting them in

18
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,400
close proximity to each other

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
is a risk.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,816
Okay, well, we may not have the Formidabomb yet, but at

21
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,320
least we finally have the ingredients

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,800
to build one.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Progress.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
And now that we have them, we...

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
We...

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,900
I literally don't remember.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,800
You're gonna have to help me out a little, Jesse.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,415
Now we just need to find a way to get it inside the

29
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:27,800
Witherstorm to blow it up.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Oh, oh dear.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I was afraid of this.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,800
With the end underwater, the Endermen will try to escape.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
We can't just leave or any of them show up.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Of course.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Of course.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
To the mine carts, everyone!

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I've been waiting ages to say that.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
To people.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I mean...

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Mm-hm.

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Incoming.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Ah!

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Oh, there you are.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
So glad you could make it.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I could have used you earlier.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Showing up just in time to hold up the trophy, huh?

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm glad you could make it.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm glad you could.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm glad you could.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm glad you could.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm glad you could.

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm glad you could.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm glad you could.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm glad you could.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm glad you could.

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm glad you could.

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm glad you could.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm glad you could.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm glad you could.

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm glad you could.
