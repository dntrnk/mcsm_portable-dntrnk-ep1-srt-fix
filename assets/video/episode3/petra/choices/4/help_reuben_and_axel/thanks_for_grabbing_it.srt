1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, thanks for grabbing that.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,880
Not a problem.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,640
Hang on a minute.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,320
He's close.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,280
Soren's close by.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,360
He's gotta be...

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
this way.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Look how bright it is!

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Sounds like the grinder is packed up.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
With loot?

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Go, go, go, go, go!

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,320
Ah!

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,920
Whoa!

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Keep moving!

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,320
Whoa!

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,680
Have to look out!

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,520
Keep down,ounty!

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
I'm coming, buddy!

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
I have had enough of this!

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Take that!

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Get your face fired!

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
There's two things I hate.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
It's running and monsters.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
A key portal?

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
That's the way out.

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Wait!

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
What?

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Look!

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Oh no!

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Petra!

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Petra!

32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Petra!

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Petra!

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Petra!

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Petra!

36
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Petra!

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
Petra!

38
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Petra!

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Petra!

40
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Petra!

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Petra!

42
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Petra!

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Petra!

44
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
Petra!

45
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Petra!

46
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Petra!

47
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Get away from them!

48
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Yah!

49
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Yah!

50
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Get in your face, monsters!

51
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.

52
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Here we go!

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Jump!

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
I'm coming!

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Oh, great.

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Just keeps getting better.

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Where's Axel?

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
He was right behind me.

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Boo!

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
See?

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,120
I told you I'd pay you back.

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Get off!

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Oh, jeez.

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Are you hurt?

65
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,120
What?

66
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,820
No, I'm not crying, just look!

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,720
So, uh...

68
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,720
What do we call that?

69
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,820
A herd of Endermen?

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,620
A flock of Endermen?

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,920
A swarm?
