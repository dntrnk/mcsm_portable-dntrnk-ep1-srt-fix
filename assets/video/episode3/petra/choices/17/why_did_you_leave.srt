1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Why did you leave us?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,100
Leave? We're right here!

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,600
You ditched us!

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Uh, we've been fighting this entire time!

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,700
Uh, what's going on?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
Uh...

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,600
You don't have to worry about the monsters.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,900
They're running away!

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,100
Worry about what they're running away from.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,800
I feel like that got bigger.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,300
It did.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,800
It's for minibomb time.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,400
Soren?

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,900
It's him! It's you!

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Hello, old friends.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,400
You're mine!

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,300
It's time to go.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,400
We only get one shot at this.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,800
Remember, once the for minibomb is crafted,

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,300
it'll explode in a matter of seconds.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,219
It means whoever's doing the crafting will be in great

22
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:17,800
danger.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
The Forminibomb.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,800
I was hoping...

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, perhaps we could draw straws.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm going to set off the for minibomb.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
That's what I was hoping for.

28
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
The rest of us will build distractions in its path.

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,800
Hopefully it will buy you some time.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,300
Jesse, take my armor.

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,800
It will help.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,300
Eh, you can take mine.

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,800
It's gotten me out of a lot of jams.

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
I insist.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
I double insist.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,300
I triple insist.

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,800
I... insist four times.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Quadruple!

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
Know it all.

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
I've never found that insult before.

41
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,800
I bet you don't know what the fifth one is, though.

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Quintuple.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,300
Alternatively, pentuple.

44
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,800
Up to you, Jesse.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,300
Wheel armor or nerd armor.
