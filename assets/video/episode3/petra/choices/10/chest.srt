1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
I found something.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
What you got?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,080
It's definitely some sort of crafting recipe.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,498
Why would someone as brilliant as Sorin need a recipe for a

5
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:13,600
shape that simple?

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,480
Because they're not for Sorin.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,760
They're for the Endermen.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,880
This must be what he's trying to teach them to build.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,800
I bet if I complete it, that would really get his attention.
