1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
I think I must be seeing things

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,937
It's like another world up here a brand new totally

3
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:09,160
unspoiled world

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,600
That's my body axle my broken battered body

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
second

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,052
What it's made of wool this tree the grass it's it's all

7
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:40,600
wool

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,669
You're telling me that we've been resting all our hopes on

9
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,900
this guy and the whole time

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,044
He's been building some totally artificial happy land.

11
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:49,500
Could it be that he just

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,390
Missed home if you miss home you go and visit you don't

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,160
build an exact replica. We came here for nothing

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,126
We came here for Sorin and for his for mita bomb. That's

15
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:05,200
still the plan

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,280
Just look around Jesse if the greatest builder of all time

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,400
has spent years working on this

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,809
What are the chances he's even gonna have that bomb? Huh?

19
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,580
I've had enough crazy for one day

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,400
What's his problem just give him some space he'll be okay

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
So I'm probably looking for

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,280
Well to open a secret door you need a secret mechanism

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
You
