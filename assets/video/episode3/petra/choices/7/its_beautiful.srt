1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
it's the most beautiful place I've ever seen

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,520
so bright

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,140
second

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,608
what it's made of wool this tree the grass it's it's all

5
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,840
wool you're telling

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,190
me that we've been resting all our hopes on this guy and

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,240
the whole time he's been

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,112
building some totally artificial happy land could it be

9
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,520
that he just missed

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,224
home if you miss home you go and visit you don't build an

11
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,040
exact replica we came

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,760
here for nothing we came here for Sorin and for his

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,194
formidable that's still the plan just look around Jesse if

14
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,800
the greatest builder

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,908
of all time has spent years working on this what are the

16
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,240
chances he's even gonna

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,360
have that bomb huh I got enough crazy for one day

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,240
what's his problem just give him some space he'll be okay

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:32,414
so I'm probably looking for well to open a secret door you

20
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:35,880
need a secret mechanism

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,960
you
