1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's a haunting of Enderman.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,355
We might want to hold off on the grammar lessons until

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:05,700
later.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,400
Which way are we headed, Jesse?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,400
Stuff like that doesn't work in the Nether.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
Probably not the end, either.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Great!

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,300
Man, so we were trapped...

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,400
...and now, we're lost.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,000
At least we're alive...

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,800
...well.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Yeah.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,000
We just have to keep on truckin' till we get to Soren.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Face it, Jesse...

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
...we might never find this guy.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
There he is.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,300
That has to be Soren.

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,600
Who else would build a staircase in the end?

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
We gotta go.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,400
Everyone, follow me.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
I'll get us to the other side!

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,600
It's not a good idea.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Jesse's right.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,900
Actually, you know what?

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll just go.

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Give me a chance.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just say the word...

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,000
...and I'll do it.
