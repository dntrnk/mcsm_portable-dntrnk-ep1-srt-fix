1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,187
Call it whatever you want. As long as we don't look at

2
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:03,240
them, we'll be fine. Yeah

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,143
Yeah, we might want to hold off on the grammar lessons

4
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:09,640
until later. Which way are we headed Jesse?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,331
Stuff like that doesn't work in the nether probably not the

6
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:19,960
end either

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,480
Great

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,619
Man, so we were trapped and now we're lost at least we're

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:29,160
alive

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
well

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,160
Yeah

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,720
We just have to keep on trucking till we get to soren

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,240
Face it Jesse

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,080
We might never find this guy. There is

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,635
That has to be soren who else would build a staircase in

16
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:48,080
the end

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,020
We gotta go everyone follow me I'll get us to the other side

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,920
It's not a good idea

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Jesse's right

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Actually, you know what I'll just go

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,440
Give me a chance just say the word and I'll do it
