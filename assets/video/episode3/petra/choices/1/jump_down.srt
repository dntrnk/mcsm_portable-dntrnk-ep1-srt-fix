1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Looks pretty good.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's dark, but other than that, we're okay.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Heading down.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Don't look up. I've got to work up the nerve.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Wait!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You have to say that now?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Something's not right.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why are we screaming?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Get away! I got you! They touched me!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, all right. It's safe now.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Everyone okay?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I just slipped.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's that smell?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Just breathe.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's that smell?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just breathe through your mouth.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Axel already does that.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's get out of here.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Stay close, boy.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We have to get out of here!

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We have to get out of here!

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We just got here.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You don't understand.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is a grinder.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're meant to kill monsters.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,971
Trouble is they can't tell the difference between monsters

33
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,000
and people.
