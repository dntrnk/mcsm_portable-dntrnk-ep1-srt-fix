1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
They can't hurt us if we don't look at them, right?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,000
So we just keep our eyes closed.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Forever.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
One constant about endermen is that they hate water.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,400
If we can force that fountain to overflow somehow.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Jesse, you still have the endermen suit.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Put that on and you'll be able to safely reach the fountain.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,500
Yuck.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,598
Just when I thought I'd never have to smell this thing

10
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:28,000
again.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,600
Good luck, dude.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,600
We'll, uh, all watch from here then.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Where it's safe.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,800
Phew.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,600
Try not to die.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ah!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, everybody, let's go.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's the holdup?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They're everywhere.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How are we supposed to get through this?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I mean, physically and psychologically.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Say we somehow make it.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't see how this won't become a reoccurring nightmare.
