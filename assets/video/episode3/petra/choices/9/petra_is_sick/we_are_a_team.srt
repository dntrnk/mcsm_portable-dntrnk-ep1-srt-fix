1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,773
If we stick together we can do anything even something that

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:07,100
feels impossible it just feels extra impossible now

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,840
Then we stick together extra hard

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,609
Okay, I just kind of wish Petra would tell everybody just

5
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,440
make things easier I

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,040
Kind of need to get at that lever you're blocking

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Thanks

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Yep

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
That's weird

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,900
Hey everyone, I think I found soren's way out

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
Nope don't want it don't need it. Thanks

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,653
We'll check out the rest of the house see if we can find

13
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,160
soren before he finds us

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
Let's see what's going on behind this door

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,280
That's him soren

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
It's just recording

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
After all that

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,464
We came all this way and for what we're no closer to soren

19
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:24,280
than before

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,600
You
