1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,993
It just means you gotta step up more than you have already,

2
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:04,400
okay?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Okay.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,300
I just kinda wish Petra would tell everybody.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
Just make things easier.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,100
I kinda need to get at that lever you're blocking.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thanks.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yep.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's... weird.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey everyone, I think I found Soren's way out!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Nope. Don't want it, don't need it.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thanks.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We'll check out the rest of the house.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
See if we can find Soren before he finds us.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's see what's going on behind this door.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's him!

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Soren!

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What the?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's just a recording.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
After all that, he's not even here?

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We came all this way and for what?

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We're no closer to Soren than before.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thanks for watching!
