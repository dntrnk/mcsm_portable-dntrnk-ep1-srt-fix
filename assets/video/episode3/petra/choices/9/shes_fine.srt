1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
Petra can take care of herself you just worry about you

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,420
you're hiding something

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,431
and by not telling me the truth you are putting all of us

4
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,120
in danger why don't you

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,832
go back to looking for soren I know you're sick of talking

6
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:17,320
to me

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,520
I kind of need to get at that lever you're blocking fine

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,392
that wasn't too hard wasn't walking one foot to the left

9
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:40,560
nope I think I got that

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,840
covered that's weird

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,400
hey everyone I think I found soren's way out

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,989
nope don't want it don't need it thanks we'll check out the

13
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:09,000
rest of the house

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,040
see if we can find soren before he finds us

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,840
let's see what's going on behind this door

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
so

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:50,191
And I call that one Symphony in E. A new composition to

18
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:56,680
celebrate my newest discovery.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
That's him!

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,228
In time, I observe one place of block on top of another

21
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:01,680
block.

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
What the?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
It's just a recording.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,680
After all that, he's not even here?

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
We came all this way and for what?

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,680
We're no closer to Soren than before.
