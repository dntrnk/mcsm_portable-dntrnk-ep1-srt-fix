1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,134
we're so close I can taste it I don't think so Jesse unless

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,440
Soren recorded

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,630
instructions for how to find the formidable this is the end

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,280
of the road

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,331
who's to say he didn't maybe there's something useful on

6
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:15,200
this record

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
I can figure out what he's talking about

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Hmm, hide among them, hide among who?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Uh, Jesse? Do you think Soren is talking about... them?

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,073
I guess everybody needs hobbies even if they are really

11
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:53,200
really really dangerous

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,200
you think he's actually training Enderman to build stuff?

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,200
I think he thinks he's training Enderman to build stuff

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
let's look around see what we could find out

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,956
Olivia check it out looks like a taller one was hanging

16
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:15,200
there but it's missing

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,983
because Soren must be wearing it this is the disguise he

18
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:20,200
was talking about

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,670
In order to walk amongst the Enderman you have to become an

20
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,200
Enderman

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,200
kind of stinky but it fits

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,900
more than kind of stinky I'm sorry to say it's so weird I

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,200
know it's you in there

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
but I still don't want to look at you

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,185
the missing disguise is the one he had to put on before

26
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,200
going outside

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
he must be conducting his experiment right now

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
which means if we want to get to Soren

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
we have to go out there to do it

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I'll just wait here

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Thanks for watching!
