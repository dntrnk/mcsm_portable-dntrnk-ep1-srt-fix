1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, this record didn't turn on by itself.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,111
Oh, good point. I guess he really likes the sound of his

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,000
own voice then.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,417
Maybe there's something useful on this record. If I can

5
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:13,000
figure out what he's talking about.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,188
I've worked up a simple set of building instructions to

7
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,000
inspire them.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,666
I will disguise myself and hide among them in order to

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,000
observe them more closely.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hmm. Hide among them. Hide among who?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Uh... Jesse? Do you think Soran is talking about... them?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,120
I guess everybody needs hobbies. Even if they are really,

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,000
really, really dangerous.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You think he's actually training Enderman to build stuff?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I think he thinks he's training Enderman to build stuff.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's look around, see what we can find out.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,780
Olivia, check it out. Looks like a taller one was hanging

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,000
there, but it's missing.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Because Soran must be wearing it. This is the disguise he

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
was talking about.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You mean...

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,442
In order to walk amongst the Enderman, you have to become

23
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:20,000
an Enderman.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Kind of stinky, but it fits.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ugh, more than kind of stinky, I'm sorry to say.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,670
It's so weird. I know it's you in there, but I still don't

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,000
want to look at you.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,357
The missing disguise is the one he had to put on before

29
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:41,000
going outside.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He must be conducting a training.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know. I don't know.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know. I don't know.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,142
The missing disguise is the one he had to put on before

34
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,000
going outside.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He must be conducting his experiment right now.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Which means if we want to get to Soran...

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We have to go out there to do it.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll just wait here.
