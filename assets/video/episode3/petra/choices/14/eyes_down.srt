1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Keep your eyes down, everyone. Grab on to me.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,439
I guess if this is the only way we're gonna make it back to

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,200
the trap door...

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Maybe we should, uh, turn around...

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
...or not.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
This guy's right in my face.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Yeah!

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Oh!

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Oh!

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Oh!

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Oh!

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Oh!

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Oh! When I constructed this place, I worried about how

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
flammable my building material was.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,591
So I installed a fire suppression system to prevent the

16
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,200
whole thing from going up in flames.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
So there's more water?

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,958
Much more. If we activate it, it could disperse all these

19
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,200
Endermen while we swim to safety.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Can we reach the controls from here?

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,200
The lever. It's right up there.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Yeesh.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,542
I don't know how much water this thing is gonna kick out,

24
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:44,200
so everybody...

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
It's working!

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Well done, Jesse.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Now, time to swim to that trap door.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm gonna go get the water.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm gonna go get the water.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm gonna go get the water.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm gonna go get the water.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Now, time to swim to that trap door.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
OK!

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
We made it!

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Making it is relative.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,320
Oh, come on

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,368
You seem like a person who appreciates cool stuff that's

38
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:30,280
cool for no reason

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Hold on to your socks

40
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Oh
