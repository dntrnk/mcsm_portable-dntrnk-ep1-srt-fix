1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Everyone, just hold on to me. I'll guide us through them.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,105
I guess if this is the only way we're gonna make it back to

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,000
the trap door...

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Maybe we should, uh, turn around... or not.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This guy's right in my base.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, when I constructed this place, I worried about how

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
flammable my building material was.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,989
So I installed a fire suppression system to prevent the

9
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,000
whole thing from going up in flames.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So there's more water?

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,758
Much more. If we activate it, it could disperse all these

12
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,000
endermen while we swim to safety.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Can we reach the controls from here?

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The lever! It's right up there!

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeesh.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,027
I don't know how much water this thing is gonna kick out,

17
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,000
so everybody...

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's working!

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well done, Jesse! Now, time to swim to that trap door!

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We made it!

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Making it is relative.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, come on!

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,433
Not that this isn't a ton of fun, but grab that permitted

24
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,000
bomb and get out of here!

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
One small problem. Tiny. Really?

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I haven't actually built it yet.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's a small problem?

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,684
You seem like a person who appreciates cool stuff that's

29
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:32,000
cool for no reason.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thanks?

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Go ahead and throw that lever behind you!

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,596
Hold on to your socks, because they're about to get blown

33
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:44,000
off!

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Go to work, boys!

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Ouch! Yikes!
