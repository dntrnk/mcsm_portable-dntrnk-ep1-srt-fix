1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
I need you to be a hero.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,480
Hmm, I see.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,120
And what do you think a hero would do in this situation?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,720
A hero would give me his vermitabom.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,358
There's a wither storm on the loose and it's eating the

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:22,720
world.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Ah, I see. You misspoke.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,800
You don't need me. You need my stuff.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,040
I've found that when you give people what they want,

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,280
they turn on you.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Who turned on you?

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
All of them.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
It's why I prefer Endermen.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,000
They always do what you expect, almost to a fault.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,880
I have the amulet.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,840
What?

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,720
Gabriel gave it to me.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Gabriel?

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,880
Gabriel asked me to reassemble the Order of the Stone.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,560
The Order of the Stone?

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,400
They asked for me?

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,120
Gabriel is your friend.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,320
Hmm, I don't know.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,000
Does he ever talk about me?

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,360
Uh, sure.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,720
What kinds of things do they say?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,560
That you were missed.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Really?

29
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,960
Maybe it was more missing.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,840
You have to read between the lines.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,640
Yes, yes you do.

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,640
But what about you?

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
Are you my friend?

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,080
As long as we're on the subject?

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,040
Not to put you on the spot.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Hey.

37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Hey.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Hey.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Hey.

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Hey.
