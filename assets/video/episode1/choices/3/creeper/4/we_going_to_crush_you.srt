00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're going to crush you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't know if you know this, but we're pretty good.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, wait. I get it. It's like a joke, right?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, I'm serious. We're going to destroy you.

The winners will also meet, in person, Gabriel the Warrior.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Whoa, handshake? We don't have a handshake.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We'll just make one up.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
