1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
You know how you have those experiences you remember and

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,000
reminisce about for the rest of your lives?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,155
This isn't one of those. Let's never discuss this ever

5
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:09,500
again.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Can you throw up, like, inside your body?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Uh-huh. I know, because I just did. About five times.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Wow. Look at this place.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,572
All these tracks converge at this point. You could probably

10
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,500
get anywhere in the world from here.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
There's the portal.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
This is what Gabriel was talking about.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
That's our way out.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
It must lead back to the surface.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
The surface is also where that creature is.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,900
He's right. We have no idea what we're walking into. It

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,500
could be dangerous.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Thanks for being so brave, Axel.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Alright, I'm gonna go. I'm going. I'm going right now.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Like, right right now.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I just need to make sure I have everything I'll need.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I think I put the thing over in the...
