00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Find anything interesting in that book?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,455
The only thing I've found so far is that the amulet was

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:09,000
used to track the positions of the members of the Order.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And does it mention how?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's less technical and more historical.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thanks for watching!
