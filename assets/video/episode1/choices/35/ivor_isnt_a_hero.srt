1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
There must be a reason he's never been mentioned.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Maybe he was different back then.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Maybe they kicked him out.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,800
This is so crazy.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
The Order might not be what we thought they were,

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
but Petra is still out there.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
That monster is still out there.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,300
Jesse's right.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,800
We need to focus on what we came here to do.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Where do these stairs go?

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
Only one way to find out.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Now this is cool.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Wow.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,300
What happened to the walls?

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,300
More like, what happened to this whole place?

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
This must have been where they met.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
So where are they then?

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Gabriel said that once we find the temple,

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,300
the amulet would lead us to the Order of the Stone.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Well, what are you waiting for? Pull it out then.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Is something supposed to happen?

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Well, that was a letdown.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
There's got to be something we're missing.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Look around and see if you can find anything.
