1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,735
This might explain why Ivor had such a grudge against

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:03,200
Gabriel.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
They lied to us. They lied to the whole world.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Why would they do this?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,700
This is so... crazy.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,687
The Order might not be what we thought they were, but Petra

7
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:16,700
is still out there.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,700
That monster is still out there.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,700
Jesse's right. We need to focus on what we came here to do.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,700
Where do these stairs go?

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Only one way to find out.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
Let's go.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
Now this is cool.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Wow.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
What happened to the walls?

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,700
More like, what happened to this whole place?

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,700
This must have been where they met.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,700
So, where are they then?

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,838
Gabriel said that once we find the temple, the amulet would

20
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,700
lead us to the Order of the Stone.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Well, what are you waiting for? Pull it out then.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Is something supposed to happen?

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Well, that was a let down.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,700
There's got to be something we're missing.

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Look around and see if you can find anything.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,700
Thanks for watching.
