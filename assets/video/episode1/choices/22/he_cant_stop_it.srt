1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He's lost control of it!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, no need to be alarmed, my friends.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I have an elixir that will destroy this creature.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That potion, is that?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Uh-oh.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It should work. I took such care.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Axel, you've got to throw the real potion.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But finders keepers.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You thieves, you're ruining everything!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Axel, come on!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Jesse, throw it!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's protecting itself!

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now the command block exposed, the potion is useless!

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It wasn't supposed to happen like this!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Martin! You coward, come back here!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Jesse, help me!

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Help, help!

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you. I've always read about one thing.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't defeat that thing.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Not on my own.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everyone's running away!

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Axel, will you help me?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Will you help me?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Of course!

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Follow me!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Out of my way, chickens!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No!

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait!

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sam, up here!

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Somebody help me!

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Guys!

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Help!

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The End
