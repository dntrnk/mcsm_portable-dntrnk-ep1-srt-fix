1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
You're gonna have to make a run for it, okay?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
I'll meet you back in town, I promise!

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Get out of here now!

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Get off me!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Come on, let's get out of the open.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I wanna show you something.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Not that this isn't a really cool dimly lit tunnel, but...

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How far away is this thing you want to show me?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,606
Careful, Jesse. You don't want to get a reputation as a

10
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:02,000
wimp.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This isn't my first time in a cave, Petra.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, but have you ever seen... a wither skull?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Whoa!

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Fresh from the nether.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's insane, Petra! You could've gotten yourself killed!

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't worry so much. I can handle myself.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's this guy I'm meeting up with at Endercon.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He's gonna trade me a diamond for it.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Why didn't he just go get the skull himself?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,718
He's not the kind of guy who has time to do something like

21
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:30,000
that.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What kind of guy is he, then?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The kind who understands the value of hard work.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Wow.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wow what?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,028
In a single day, you went to the nether, you killed a

27
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,000
wither skeleton.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I mean, I did build a super cool statue, but still...

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's pretty sweet being you, huh?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know, you could come with me.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean, if you're too nervous, I totally get it.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I wouldn't mind a little backup.
