1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Too many of them, buddy!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Don't leave that spot no matter what.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You hear me?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I got you!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Get away from him!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, he got you!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Jesus!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Jesus!

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Come on, let's get out of the open.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello!

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I wanna show you something.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Not that this isn't a really cool dimly lit tunnel, but...

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How far away is this thing you wanna show me?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Careful, Jesse. You don't wanna get a reputation as a wimp.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This isn't my first time in a cave, Petra.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, but have you ever seen...

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
...a wither skull?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Whoa!

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Fresh from the nether.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's insane, Petra! You could've gotten yourself killed.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't worry so much. I can handle myself.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's this guy I'm meeting up with at Endercon.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's gonna trade me a diamond for it.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why didn't he just go get the skull himself?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,718
He's not the kind of guy who has time to do something like

26
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:37,000
that.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What kind of guy is he, then?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The kind who understands the value of hard work.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wow.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wow what?

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,028
In a single day, you went to the nether, you killed a

32
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,000
wither skeleton.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I mean, I did build a super cool statue, but still...

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
...it's pretty sweet being you, huh?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know, you could come with me.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I mean, if you're too nervous, I totally get it.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I wouldn't mind a little backup.
