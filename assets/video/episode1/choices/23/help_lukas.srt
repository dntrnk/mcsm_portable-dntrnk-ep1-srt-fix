1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No!

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No!

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Do we still have everyone?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,709
We just set off from my fortress. We'd better protect it

5
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:54,000
then.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thanks for that, just a minute.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Incoming!

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This way.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hold it! Exide the tower!

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,641
The V-R chamber is built entirely of obsidian. We should be

11
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:27,000
untouchable in there.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Get out of here!

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Herb, if you can get through the portal, you'll be safe.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Uh, something's not right here.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not red.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's get out of here!

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everyone, get in! Now!

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Gabriel!

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are so many of them. I can't save them all.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't stop this by myself. We need to find the others.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Others?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,734
The swords have been missing for years. But the others? You

24
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,000
must seek them out.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Take this amulet and guard it with your life.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can do this.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You must.
