1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can do it, Axel.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's right, I can do it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,483
Whatever's on the other side has no idea when it's got

4
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:10,000
coming.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright, here I go. Thanks, Jesse.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Right behind you.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Be safe up there, Axel.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ready or not, here I come.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Get off of me!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, man. That was close.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm never going first again.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where are we?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In the dark in the middle of nowhere?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Maybe we should bed down for the night.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's dangerous to be out when it's this dark.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought we were headed toward a temple.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're looking for a giant building.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It should be pretty obvious.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ivor said...

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, Ivor said...

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, then maybe this is the temple.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Take it easy, Axel.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You called me stupid.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, I didn't.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But you wanted to.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, I didn't.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Huh? Did you say something?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We have to build a shelter.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I thought that was what I said, but...

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yup, that's totally...

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's getting dark and stuff.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I say we build a tree house.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That'll take forever and won't be exposed while we do it.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We just need a quick and dirty hut.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Look, whatever it is, we gotta do it fast.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,442
In a hut, we won't know what's coming until it's knocking

38
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:56,000
on our door.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A tree house is gonna be spider town.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I hate spiders.
