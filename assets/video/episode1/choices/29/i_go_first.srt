1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
I'll go first.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,500
That's not what I was saying.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm going.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, if you absolutely insist.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Well, see you guys on the other side, I guess.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Be careful.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Thanks, Jesse.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, not what I was expecting.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, man.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That was close.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There was a zombie.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is it dead?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I mean, you know, it's probably dead.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Where are we?

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In the dark in the middle of nowhere?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Maybe we should bed down for the night.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's dangerous to be out when it's this dark.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I thought we were headed toward a temple.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're looking for a giant building.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It should be pretty obvious.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've or said...

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, I've or said,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
well, then maybe this is the temple.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Take it easy, Axel.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He called me stupid.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, I'm not.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But you wanted to.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, I didn't.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Huh?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Did you say something?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We have to build a shelter.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I thought that was what I said, but, uh...

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yep, that's totally...

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's getting dark and stuff.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I say we build a tree house.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That'll take forever and we'll be exposed while we do it.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We just need a quick and dirty hut.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Look, whatever it is, we gotta do it fast.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What?

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,257
In a hut, we won't know what's coming until it's knocking

43
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,000
on our door.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A tree house is gonna be spider town.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I hate spiders.
