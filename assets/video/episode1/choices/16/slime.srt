00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hmm... I bet I could reach that glass with a slime block.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, you've come to the right place. Our slime's the best.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, hey, we meet again. One slime block, please.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't give out slime blocks here. Just slime balls.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,064
We've got a limited supply today, and we're only giving out

6
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:28,000
two per customer.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Can I please, please have some slime?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ugh, whatever.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A round of slime balls for everyone, please.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,211
Wait, this is only eight slime balls. We need one more to

11
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:41,000
make a block.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,514
Okay, we need to find another way to get some more slime.

13
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:44,000
And quick.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On it.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thanks for watching!
