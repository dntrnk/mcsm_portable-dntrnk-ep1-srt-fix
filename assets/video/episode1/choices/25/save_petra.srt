1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Thanks, Jesse.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Gabriel's still out there!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Jesse!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
No!

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No!

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:33,280
Where's Petra?

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
We did everything we could.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,160
What are you saying?

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
It was chaos.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,760
There wasn't much I could do.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,120
Jesse's right.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,760
Petra is still up there.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
I got scared.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,440
Just for a second.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,160
You got scared?

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
It wasn't my fault.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,480
You got scared and it's not your fault?

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Back off, Axel.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
We gotta go back.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
She just needs more time.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Petra needs our help.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
We're going.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Hey, there she is!

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Come on, come on.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
You again.

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:35,720
Ivor.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,080
You ruined everything.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,280
You can't blame us.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Your plan, your monster, your fault.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Maybe.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,400
But if you hadn't stolen from me, I would have destroyed it.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,520
And all of those people would have been saved.

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,840
There's nothing left up there.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,040
Nothing but that wither storm.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,720
Why are we wasting time talking to this jerk?

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
We have to go and get Petra.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
The girl.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
I saw her.

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
What?

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,520
While I was running toward the portal, I passed her.

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,160
She was running in the opposite direction.

42
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Such bravery.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,433
Of course, there's a fine line between bravery and

44
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,400
stupidity.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:28,160
And your friend has crossed it.

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm saying she's stupid.
