1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Huh?

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,160
What?

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,080
Where's Petra?

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,960
We did everything we could.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
What are you saying?

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
It was chaos.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,400
There wasn't much I could do.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,680
Jesse's right.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
Petra is still up there.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
I got scared.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,960
Just for a second.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,840
You got scared?

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
It wasn't my fault.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,160
You got scared and it's not your fault?

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Back off, Axel.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,220
We gotta go back.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,960
She just needs more time.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Petra needs our help.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
We're going.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
There she is.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Come on, come on.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
You again.

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Ivor.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,360
You ruined everything.

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,360
You can't blame us.

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Your plan, your monster, your fault.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Maybe.

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,360
But if you hadn't stolen from me, I would have destroyed it.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,360
And all of those people would have been saved.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
There's nothing left up there.

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Nothing but that weather storm.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Why are we wasting time talking to this jerk?

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
We have to go and get Petra.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
The girl.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I saw her.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
What?

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
While I was running toward the portal, I passed her.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,760
She was running in the opposite direction.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Such bravery.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Of course.

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,760
There's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,760
And your friend has crossed it.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,160
I'm saying she's stupid.
