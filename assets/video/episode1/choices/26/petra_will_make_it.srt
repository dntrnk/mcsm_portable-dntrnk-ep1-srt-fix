1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
She's going to make it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
You're concerned about your friend.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
It's aberable.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
You're all going to be dead very soon.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll see about that.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,500
You don't even realize you're in danger right now.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
So are you.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,846
Through that tunnel is a network of minecarts built by the

9
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,000
Order of the Stone.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's your only way out.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Much as I hate to admit it, you might be right.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Bravo for embracing the truth.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
What was that?

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,027
I would wish you good luck, but luck won't carry you

15
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:38,000
through the nether.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You have my sympathies.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's get out of here!

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Run!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Aaaaaah!

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This must be what Ivor was talking about.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everybody hold on!

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wow.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The nether.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, that is a lot of lava.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And fire.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And other things that could burn you to death.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh no!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, that's a drop. That is very, very much a drop.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We were talking about it, you guys.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What drop? Oh, you weren't kidding.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks for watching!
