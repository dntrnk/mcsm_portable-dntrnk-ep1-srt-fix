1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our friend is in trouble because of you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're trapped in the Nether because of you.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You have much bigger problems to contend with.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Through that tunnel is a network of mind cards,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
built by the Order of the Stone.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's your only way out.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Much as I hate to admit it, he might be right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're off.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're embracing the truth.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What was that?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,166
I would wish you good luck, but luck won't carry you

12
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,000
through the Nether.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You have my sympathies.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's get out of here! Run!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This must be what Ivor was talking about.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Everybody hold on!

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wow.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The Nether.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, that is a lot of lava.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And fire.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And other things that could burn you to death.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're not going to get away with this!

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're going to get away with this!

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And other things that could burn you to death.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh no!

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, that's a drop. That is very, very much a drop.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you talking about, new guy?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What drop?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, you weren't kidding.
