1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's do this.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Alright.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good job, Jesse.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This must be their enchantment room.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Doesn't this look like Ivor's creepy basement?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Find anything useful?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Not sure about useful, but definitely interesting.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There is a lot of history in this room.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,110
The battle was fierce, but the Order of the Stone emerged

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,041
triumphant, saving the land and ensuring that peace and

11
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,000
prosperity would reign forever.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, not exactly forever.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,067
These five members, five friends, together would give so

14
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:25,000
much to gain their rightful place, as five is.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They would author their own end.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
They would slay a dragon.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ivor was a member of the Order of the Stone?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The story's never mentioned him.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is so crazy.
