1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's do this.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,600
All right.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,720
Good job, Jesse.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,720
See?

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,720
This must be their enchantment room.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Doesn't this look like Ivor's creepy basement?

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
Find anything useful?

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Not sure about useful, but definitely interesting.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:57,720
There is a lot of history in this room.

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,830
The battle was fierce, but the Order of the Stone emerged

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,761
triumphant, saving the land and ensuring that peace and

12
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:10,720
prosperity would reign forever.

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Well, not exactly forever.

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,120
These five members, five friends, together would give so

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,720
much to gain their rightful place as five years.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,720
They would author their own end.

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,720
They would slay a dragon.

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Ivor was a member of the Order of the Stone?

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
The story's never mentioned him.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,720
This is so crazy.
