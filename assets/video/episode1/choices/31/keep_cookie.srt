1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you had to, which would you rather fight?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,016
A hundred chicken-sized zombies or ten zombie-sized

3
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:26,000
chickens?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Choose wisely.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's a good one.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let me think.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How can you guys joke at a time like this?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Petra is still out there.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Petra wouldn't mind at all.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
She'd want us to keep our spirits up.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Fire her. I don't know. It feels wrong.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Fine. Then we should get some rest.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We gotta start looking for this temple as early as we can.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,625
Now, my guess is if we start at the portal and kinda split

15
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,000
up...

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, what are you doing?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He's just trying to help. See?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,390
I'm sorry, Jesse. I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,000
guy telling us what's what.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm just trying to get ready for tomorrow.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,178
You're the only one wearing that stupid jacket. Don't tell

22
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:10,000
us what to do.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Take. That. Back.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Can't. Wouldn't.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,420
You know what? I get to wear this jacket because I know how

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,000
to build.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But that doesn't mean I don't know how to break things.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,687
Your threats don't scare me now that we know how you really

29
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:25,000
are.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Jesse, your friend is way out of line.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's just drop it.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be like that, Jesse.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Just... drop it.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Haven't you done enough damage for one day?

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Petra might be dead because of you.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're taking this too far, Axel.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't have to take this.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,677
Listen, why don't I just leave and let you guys hash this

39
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:45,000
out?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't leave. It's dangerous out there.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can take care of myself. It's what Axel wants, right?

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let him leave if he wants to leave.
