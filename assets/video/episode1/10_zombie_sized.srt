1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,992
I have to go with the giant chickens, not because I want to

2
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:05,985
or because I think it would be easy, but because they would

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,000
be an abomination.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Imagine their giant feet.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Like I said, an abomination.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,893
So I've got a daylight sensor on the roof, and if I did

7
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:20,000
this right, these lamps should turn on once it gets dark.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,494
I didn't want to just leave Reuben here with nothing while

9
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,000
we're at the building competition.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's coming with us.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Really?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What kind of question is that? Of course he is.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, I'm not saying he shouldn't come. I'm not.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,682
But don't you think it's a little weird that you take him

15
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:37,000
with you everywhere you go?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Reuben's my best friend.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought I was your best friend.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Both of you are.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,899
I didn't mean anything by it. I'm glad he's coming. I just

20
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,394
don't want to give people one more reason to call us

21
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:51,000
losers.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who cares what other people think?

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know. I'm just... it wears you down.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You say you're not a loser, Olivia. So win.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay. Fine.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you hear that?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh man. You guys totally freaked out. That was aweso-

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Axel, what's the matter with you?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Great. Now I'm going to smell like a pig in Endercon.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I thought we were buddies.
