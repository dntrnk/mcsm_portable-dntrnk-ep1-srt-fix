1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
That's easy. I'll take the little tiny little zombies.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,800
A hundred of them, crawling all over you with their tiny

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,300
hands.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,473
Uh... All I need is like a shovel. I'm telling you, way too

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,000
easy.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,801
So I've got a daylight sensor on the roof, and if I did this

7
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:21,300
right,

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,600
these lamps should turn on once it gets dark.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,369
I didn't want to just leave Reuben here with nothing while

10
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:29,800
we're at the building competition.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
He's coming with us.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Really?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,600
What kind of question is that? Of course he is.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Okay, I'm not saying he shouldn't come. I'm not.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,482
But don't you think it's a little weird that you take him

16
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:42,800
with you everywhere you go?

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,300
Reuben's my best friend.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
I thought I was your best friend.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,800
Both of you are.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
I didn't mean anything by it. I'm glad he's coming.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,882
I just don't want to give people one more reason to call us

22
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:56,300
losers.

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,800
Who cares what other people think?

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
I know. I'm just... It wears you down.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
You say you're not a loser, Olivia. So win.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Okay. Fine.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Do you hear that?

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
No.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Oh, man. You guys totally freaked out. That was aweso-

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Axel, what's the matter with you?

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Great. Now I'm going to smell like a pig in Endercon.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I thought we were buddies.
