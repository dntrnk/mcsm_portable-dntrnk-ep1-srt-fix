1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,012
Olivia I just stay out of this but your friends right

2
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:05,400
Olivia. I've got this just fine on my own

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,700
People can we please focus on the bigger picture

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,894
We have a very hungry wither storm and the process of

5
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:17,200
turning the whole world into its dinner

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,779
Yeah, I'll admit that thing looked real nasty and I've seen

7
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,820
some nasty stuff in my time

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,212
Too much for you was it your usual brutish approach didn't

9
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:29,940
cut it. Hey, you weren't there

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,600
All right, you didn't see how this thing just tore

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,260
everything up. You've never seen anything like it

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,320
Would you two stop fighting whoa

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,580
Jesse speaks the truth

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,100
We must find a way to defeat that monstrosity

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,260
I don't know if you've looked around yet

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,125
But this place isn't nearly the stronghold it used to be

17
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,660
most of our supplies are gone

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,904
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing. I hate

19
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,980
to say it but you have a point

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,557
Can we start crafting some men? I don't think we got that

21
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:03,300
kind of time

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,114
Only soren were here. He might have something we could use.

23
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:09,780
Oh Ellie not this again

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,140
There's something stronger than TNT

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,125
Soren had a kind of super TNT stronger and more explosive

26
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,340
than anything else in the world

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,340
The form it upon

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,994
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard all about the F bomb before

29
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:30,103
well the for minute bomb sounds perfect. We should go get

30
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:30,540
it now

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,260
Well, there's a little problem there

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,060
We don't know where soren is

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,740
But you found us. Do you know where he is?

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
Our map could locate him

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,780
Unless he's in the nether or the end but it's worth a shot
