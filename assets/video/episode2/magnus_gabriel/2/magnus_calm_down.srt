1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Magnus, as the ruler of Boomtown, I command you to shut up.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Is that so?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
Uh, people, can we please focus on the bigger picture?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
We have a very hungry wither storm

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,300
in the process of turning the whole world into its dinner.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Yeah, I'll admit.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
That thing looked real nasty.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,900
And I've seen some nasty stuff in my time.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,400
Too much for you, was it?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Your usual brutish approach didn't cut it?

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,300
Hey, you weren't there, all right?

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,100
You didn't see how this thing just tore everything up.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,500
You've never seen anything like it.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,700
Would you two stop fighting?

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Whoa!

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Yikes.

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Jesse speaks the truth.

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,500
We must find a way to defeat that monstrosity.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,100
I don't know if you've looked around yet,

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,900
but this place isn't nearly the stronghold it used to be.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
Most of our supplies are gone.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,300
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing.

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I hate to say it, but you have a point.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,500
Can we start crafting some, then?

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,700
I don't think we got that kind of time.

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,500
If only Soren were here,

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,300
he might have something we could use.

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,500
Oh, Ellie.

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,900
Not this again.

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,900
There's something stronger than TNT?

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Soren had a kind of super TNT.

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,500
Stronger and more explosive than anything else in the world.

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,900
The Formidabomb.

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,500
I've heard all about the F-bomb before.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,300
Well, the Formidabomb sounds perfect.

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,900
We should go get it now.

38
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,100
Well, there's a little problem there.

39
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,700
We don't know where Soren is.

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,500
But you found us.

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Do you know where he is?

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,300
Our map could locate him.

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,300
Unless he's in the nether or the end.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,500
But it's worth a shot.

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

46
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

57
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.

58
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm sure he's in the nether.
