1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I bet we can find him.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Jesse, do you still have the amulet I gave you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Of course.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All right, there's your light, my light.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's new.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There he is.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sorin had his fortress deep inside the mountains.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,506
After the Order broke up, that's where he went to keep

9
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:35,000
doing his experiments.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,972
Look, he invited me there a couple times, but it always

11
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,000
seemed a little...

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Weird, right? It always seemed a little weird.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,153
Then let's stop hanging around here and go get us some

14
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:47,000
super TNT.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Whoa.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Blue?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's Ivor!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ivor is going to Sorin's. We need to move.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not too far. We could probably make it on foot.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,864
Perfect. We can wait till tomorrow morning and travel with

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,000
a full day's sunlight.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Andra, is that thing catching up with us?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,521
I think I've had enough witherstorm for one day. Thank you

24
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:16,000
very much.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,442
Great, because getting caught out there in the dark is so

26
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:19,000
much better.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,178
Yeah, I don't want the witherstorm catching up with us. We

28
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,000
should go now.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to go get some water.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, everyone, let's get moving.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Jesse, right?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, hello.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We haven't had the chance to acquaint ourselves properly.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
According to Gabriel, you saved him from this witherstorm.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sounds like you're a pretty impressive individual.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm just doing my best to keep everyone safe.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can always appreciate humility.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I like you.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A slight tangent. What's the deal with your friend Olivia?

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,191
I appreciate her enthusiasm, but she can be a little much

41
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:12,000
sometimes.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She's always very eager to jump in and help.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,375
Which is sweet, of course, though sometimes I wish she

44
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,000
would think a bit more before jumping in.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Especially when she keeps getting in over her head.
