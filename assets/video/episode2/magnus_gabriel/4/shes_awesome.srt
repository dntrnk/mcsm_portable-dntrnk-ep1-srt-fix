00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,802
Olivia's one of my best friends. She's smart and she always

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:05,800
has a plan. Oh wow interesting

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,701
So why didn't you listen to her plan to come and recruit me

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:09,880
I?

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,232
Figured that we needed firepower and no one knows

6
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,720
destruction better than Magnus

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,119
The man does know how to blow things up with reckless

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,440
abandon. That's for sure

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,400
I'll do my best to not let it hurt my feelings

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Joke that was a joke

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Guys

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
I told you

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Really weren't kidding

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
How can it find me again

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,651
Come on we got to get out of here this creature never stop

16
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:58,280
so it isn't much farther we can make it

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,420
Am getting very tired of this weather storm agreed

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,522
Soren really live down here, it's so far from anyone

21
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,600
enchanting isn't it

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,480
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,280
Just don't fall okay

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,120
Oh that is deep that is very very deep

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
We've got

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh

28
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,520
It was more of a drop than I was expecting

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,890
Enderman there were so many I didn't think they ever came

30
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,920
in groups that big

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,329
No kidding it's like an Enderman party. I heard your voice

32
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,720
and thought I would come down to hell

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You
