1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,836
I don't know if you caught this but she's like your biggest

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,760
fan. You probably just make her nervous

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,340
That's an excellent point hadn't thought about that

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,040
Seems like you respect her a lot

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,440
Why didn't you listen to her plan to come and recruit me?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,279
I figure that we needed firepower and no one knows

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,040
destruction better than Magnus

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,453
The man does know how to blow things up with reckless

9
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:23,780
abandon. That's for sure

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
I'll do my best to not let it hurt my feelings

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,280
Ha joke that was a joke

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Guys

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
I told you I was gonna catch up with this

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
You really weren't kidding

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
How could it find me again

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,125
I can hash all that out later. Come on. We got to get out

17
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,440
of here. This creature never stopped

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,620
Soren's isn't much farther. We can make it

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,480
Am getting very tired of this weather storm agreed place

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,280
Soren really lived down here it's so far from anyone

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Enchanting isn't it?

23
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,360
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Columns

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't fall okay. Oh that is deep that is very very deep

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Hang on

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,760
It was more of a drop than I was expecting

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,240
So many I didn't think they ever came in groups that big

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,649
No kidding it's like an enderman party. I heard your voice

30
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:28,040
and thought I would come down to hell
