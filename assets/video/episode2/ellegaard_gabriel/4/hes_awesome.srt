00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Axel's one of my best friends. He makes me laugh and he

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,320
always sticks up for his friends

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Interesting very interesting

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,320
Then why didn't you listen to his plan to come get me?

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,982
I figured that we needed brains to fight the wither storm

6
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:17,710
and brains means elegant. Yeah, I've definitely heard that

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,160
a lot

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,125
I'll try not to let it hurt my feelings too much. Well,

9
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,700
just keep on your toes

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,020
Guys

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
I told you we're gonna catch up with this

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Really weren't kidding

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,860
How can it find me again

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,860
I

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,450
Can't all that out later, come on, we got to get out of

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,060
here this creature never stop

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,260
Soren's isn't much farther. We can make it

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,860
I

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,524
Am getting very tired of this wither storm agreed place has

21
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:28,640
gotta be just ahead. Come on

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,860
I

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,620
Soren really live down here. It's so far from anyone

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Enchanting isn't it?

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,420
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Oh

27
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,540
Just don't fall, okay. Oh

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,100
That is deep that is very very deep

29
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,860
Oh

30
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,300
It was more of a drop than I was

31
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,880
Enderman there were so many I didn't think they ever came

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,900
in groups that big

33
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,387
No kidding. It's like an enderman party. I heard your voice

34
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:22,660
and thought I would come down to hell
