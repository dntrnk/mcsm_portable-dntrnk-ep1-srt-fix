00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's such a relief to see you. I'm glad you're okay.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you hadn't pulled me out of the Witherstorms' clutches...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, let's just not think about that.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,042
I came here to the temple, hoping against hope to find

5
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,000
other survivors.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wow, did Petra get away too? Did you see?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All that creature left in its wake was Bedrock.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All those people...

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Your friend Petra...

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No one could get away.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are alive.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That means there's still hope.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Come along. Everyone else is still inside.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Boy, can't remember the last time I saw this place.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Would someone care to explain what he is doing here?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This isn't going to go well.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Right. I forgot to mention, Axel went on a little...

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
...adventure of his own while you were gone.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
An adventure to get him? Did you know about this?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,538
Look, just wait here a second while I figure out what's

21
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:14,000
going on.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Much appreciated.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,918
So, who are you then? And why'd you bring the Queen of the

24
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,000
Nerds with you?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's Jesse, my best friend.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Trust me, Jesse's totally cool.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll be the judge of that, huh?
