1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
I don't understand. How did you escape?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
If you hadn't pulled me out of the Witherstorm's clutches...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Well, let's just not think about that.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,802
I came here to the temple, hoping against hope to find

5
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,000
other survivors.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wow, did Petra get away too? Did you see?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All that creature left in its wake was bedrock.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All those people...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your friend Petra...

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No one could get away.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are alive.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That means there's still hope.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Come along. Everyone else is still inside.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Boy, can't remember the last time I saw this place.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Would someone care to explain what he is doing here?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, this isn't going to go well.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Right, I forgot to mention. Axel went on a little...

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
...adventure of his own while you were gone.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
An adventure to get him?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Did you know about this?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,538
Look, just wait here a second while I figure out what's

22
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:14,000
going on.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Much appreciated.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, who are you then?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And why'd you bring the Queen of the Nerds with you?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's Jesse, my best friend.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Trust me, Jesse's totally cool.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll be the judge of that, huh?
