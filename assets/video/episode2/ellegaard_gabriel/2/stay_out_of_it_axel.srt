1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Axle, not your fight. Stay out of it.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,240
But...

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,500
Your friend has a point. I can fight my own battles.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,500
Uh, people, can we please focus on the bigger picture?

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,300
We have a very hungry wither storm

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,000
in the process of turning the whole world into its dinner.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,200
It was terrifying.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,200
It came out of nowhere and just destroyed... everything.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,800
Little too scary for you, Ellie?

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
Couldn't just... think it away?

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
You weren't there, Magnus. I'm telling you.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,600
This thing was like nothing I've ever seen.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,923
Why? Because it's never come inside one of your little

14
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:37,600
workshops?

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Would you two stop fighting?

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,600
Whoa! Yikes.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Jesse speaks the truth.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
We must find a way to defeat that monstrosity.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,236
Well, I don't know if you've had the chance to poke around

20
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:52,100
this old dump yet,

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
but it's pretty much stripped bare.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,100
I hate to say it, but you have a point.

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,600
Can we start crafting some men?

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
I don't think we got that kind of time.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,817
If only Soren were here, he might have something we could

27
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:10,100
use.

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,100
Oh, Ellie. Not this again.

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,600
There's something stronger than TNT?

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Soren had a kind of super TNT.

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,600
Stronger and more explosive than anything else in the world.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
The Formidabomb.

33
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard all about the F-bomb before.

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,817
Well, the Formidabomb sounds perfect. We should go get it

35
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:34,100
now.

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,100
Well, there's a little problem there.

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,600
We don't know where Soren is.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
But you found us. Do you know where he is?

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,100
Our map could locate him.

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Unless he's in the Nether or the End.

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,600
But it's worth a shot.
