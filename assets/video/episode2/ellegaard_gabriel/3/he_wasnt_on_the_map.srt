1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He wasn't on the map.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Jesse, do you still have the amulet I gave you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Of course.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Alright, there's your light, my light.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's new.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There he is.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Warren had his fortress deep inside the mountains.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,506
After the order broke up, that's where he went to keep

9
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:35,000
doing his experiments.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,972
Look, he invited me there a couple times, but it always

11
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,000
seemed a little...

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Weird, right? It always seemed a little weird.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,153
Then let's stop hanging around here and go get us some

14
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:47,000
super TNT.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Whoa.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Blue?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Blue? That's Ivor!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ivor is going to Soren's. We need to move.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not too far. We could probably make it on foot.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,267
Righteous! We'll get some rest and head out first thing in

21
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,000
the morning,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
avoiding all the no time and the monsters and everything.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you had seen that monster, you wouldn't be saying that.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We need to leave, now!

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,178
Hey, I don't want the wither storm catching up with us. We

26
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:26,000
should go now.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, everyone, let's get moving.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yo, we haven't really gotten a chance to chat yet.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, hello.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,453
Gabriel over there says you saved him from this wither storm

31
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:57,000
thing.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're pretty tough, huh?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm just doing my best to keep everyone safe.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Humility. Nice. I can dig it.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What to deal with your buddy Axel?

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can't tell if he's awesome or a little bit of a dork.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's just a little, uh, doofy, you know?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,976
He's like a little puppy. You don't know whether you want

39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,000
to hug it or just walk away.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know what I'm talking about?
