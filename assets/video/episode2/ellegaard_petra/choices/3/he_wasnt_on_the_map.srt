1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He wasn't on the map.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm very curious to see it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've never actually seen it work before.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alright, there's your light, my light.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's new.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There he is.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sorin had his fortress deep inside the mountains.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,506
After the order broke up, that's where he went to keep

9
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:34,000
doing his experiments.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,716
Look, he invited me there a couple times, but it always

11
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:39,000
seemed a little...

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Weird, right? It always seemed a little weird.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,153
Then let's stop hanging around here and go get us some

14
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:46,000
super TNT.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Whoa.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Blue?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Blue? That's Ivor!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ivor is going to Sorin's. We need to move.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not too far. We could probably make it on foot.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,267
Righteous! We'll get some rest and head out first thing in

21
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,000
the morning,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
avoiding all the no time and monsters and everything.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you had seen that monster, you wouldn't be saying that.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We need to leave, now!

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,178
Yeah, I don't want the Witherstorm catching up with us. We

26
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:25,000
should go now.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, everyone, let's get moving.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yo, we haven't really gotten a chance to chat yet.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, hello.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,173
I heard you saved your friend back there from this

32
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,000
Witherstorm thing.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Pretty tough, huh?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm just doing my best to keep everyone safe.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Humility? Nice. I can dig it.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's the deal with your buddy Axel?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can't tell if he's awesome or a little bit of a dork.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's just a little, uh, doofy, you know?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's like a little puppy.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You don't know whether you want to hug it or just walk away.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You know what I'm talking about?
