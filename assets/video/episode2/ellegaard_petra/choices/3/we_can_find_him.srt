1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,642
I bet we can find him. I'm very curious to see it. I've

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:05,960
never actually seen it work before

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,980
All right, there's your light my light

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,560
That's new

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,520
There he is

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,120
Sorin had his fortress deep inside the mountains after the

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,472
order broke up. That's where he went to keep doing his

8
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:34,280
experiments

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,808
Look, he invited me there a couple times, but it always

10
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,817
seemed a little weird, right? It always seemed a little

11
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:41,200
weird

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,966
Then let's stop hanging around here and go get us some

13
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:45,560
super TNT

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,560
I

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Bore is going to soren's we need to move

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,880
It's not too far we could probably make it on foot

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,802
righteous get some rest and head out first thing in the

18
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,240
morning avoiding all the

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Monsters

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,462
If you had seen that monster, you wouldn't be saying that

21
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,900
we need to leave now

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,394
Yeah, I don't want the weather storm catching up with us.

23
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:25,120
We should go now

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Okay

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
Everyone let's get moving

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,320
Yo, we haven't really gotten a chance to chat yet. Oh

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,241
Hello, I heard you saved your friend back there from this

28
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,760
wither storm thing. You're pretty tough, huh?

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,980
I'm just doing my best to keep everyone safe

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,540
Humility nice. I can dig it

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
What's the deal with your buddy Axel?

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,920
Can't tell if he's awesome or a little bit of a dork

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
He's just a little

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Doofy, you know

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,300
Little puppy you don't know whether you want to hug it or

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,400
just walk away

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
You know what I'm talking about
