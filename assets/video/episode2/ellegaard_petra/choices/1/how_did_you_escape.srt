1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I don't understand. How did you escape?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,632
You pulled me out of that wither storm's crutches and I ran

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,120
and ran and ran for the temple

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
If you hadn't saved me

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
Well

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
I owe you everything jesse

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,240
Wow, did cabriel get away too? Did you see?

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,423
It's all a blur, but the wither storm left almost nothing

9
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:20,800
behind

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,120
everything

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Everyone was just gone

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
It even got cabriel

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,608
I wouldn't believe that anything could defeat gabriel if I

14
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,680
hadn't seen it for myself. This is terrible

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
Boy can't remember the last time I saw this place

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,600
Would someone care to explain what he is doing here

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,480
Call this a hunch, but do you two not like each other?

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,400
Right, I forgot to mention axel went on a little

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,707
Adventure of his own while you were gone an adventure to

20
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:04,240
get him

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Did you know about this?

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,075
Look, just wait here a second while I figure out what's

23
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:10,480
going on

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Much appreciated

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,884
So who are you then and why did you bring the queen of the

26
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:23,120
nerds with you that's jesse my best friend

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
Trust me jesse's totally cool

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
i'll uh

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll be the judge of that, huh?
