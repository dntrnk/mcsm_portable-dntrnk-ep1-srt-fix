00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
It's such a relief to see you. I'm glad you're okay

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,334
You pulled me out of that wither storms crutches, and I ran

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:07,940
and ran and ran for the temple

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,520
If you hadn't saved me

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,562
Well, I owe you everything Jesse Wow did Gabriel get away,

6
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:17,040
too. Did you see?

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,939
It's all a blur, but the wither storm left almost nothing

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:21,320
behind

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,880
everything

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,880
Everyone was just gone

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,680
It even got Gabriel

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,817
Wouldn't believe that anything could defeat Gabriel if I

13
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:36,440
hadn't seen it for myself. This is terrible

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,360
Boy can't remember the last time I saw this place

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,320
Would someone care to explain what he is doing here

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,160
Called us a hunch, but do you two not like each other?

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,120
Right. I forgot to mention Axel went on a little

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,490
Adventure of his own while you were gone an adventure to

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,000
get him

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Did you know about this?

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,772
Look, just wait here a second while I figure out what's

22
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:11,200
going on

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Much appreciated

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,412
So who are you then and why'd you bring the queen of the

25
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,800
nerds with you that's Jesse my best friend

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,680
Trust me. Jesse's totally cool

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,480
I'll be the judge of that, huh?
