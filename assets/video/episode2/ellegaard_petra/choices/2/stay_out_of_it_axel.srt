1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Axle, not your fight. Stay out of it.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,240
But...

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,500
Your friend has a point. I can fight my own battles.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,500
Uh, people, can we please focus on the bigger picture?

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,300
We have a very hungry wither storm

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,000
in the process of turning the whole world into its dinner.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,200
It was terrifying.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,100
It came out of nowhere and just destroyed... everything.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Little too scary for you, Ellie?

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
Couldn't just... think it away?

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
You weren't there, Magnus. I'm telling you.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,600
This thing was like nothing I've ever seen.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,600
Why?

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,800
Because it's never come inside one of your little workshops.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,900
Would you two stop fighting?

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,700
Whoa!

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,800
Yikes. Jesse's right.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,900
We need to find some way to stop that thing.

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,611
Well, I don't know if you've had the chance to poke around

20
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:50,500
this old dump yet,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,900
but it's pretty much stripped bare.

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,300
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
I hate to say it, but you have a point.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,900
Can we start crafting some, then?

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,800
I don't think we got that kind of time.

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,317
If only Soren were here, he might have something we could

27
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:08,600
use.

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,100
Oh, Ellie. Not this again.

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,500
There's something stronger than TNT?

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Soren had a kind of super TNT.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,800
Stronger and more explosive than anything else in the world.

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,500
The Formidabomb.

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard all about the F-bomb before.

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,833
Well, the Formidabomb sounds perfect. We should go get it

35
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,100
now.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,700
Well, there's a little problem there.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,300
We don't know where Soren is.

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,500
But you found us.

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,200
Do you know where he is?

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Our map could locate him.

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,400
Unless he's in the nether, or the end.

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
But it's worth a shot.
