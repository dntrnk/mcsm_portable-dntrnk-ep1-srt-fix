00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,725
Axel's one of my best friends. He makes me laugh and he

2
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:04,360
always sticks up for his friends

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Interesting very interesting

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,300
Then why didn't you listen to his plan to come get me?

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,962
I figured that we needed brains to fight the wither storm

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:17,690
and brains means elegant. Yeah, I've definitely heard that

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,140
a lot

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,085
I'll try not to let it hurt my feelings too much. Well,

9
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:24,660
just keep on your toes

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,060
Guys

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
I told you we're gonna catch up with this

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Really weren't kidding

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,780
Again

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,780
I

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,189
Want we gotta get out of here again, not again so it isn't

17
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,260
much farther we can make it

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,780
I

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,380
Am getting very tired of this wither storm agreed

20
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,381
Soren really live down here so far from anyone enchanting

21
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,540
isn't it?

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,020
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns

23
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,780
Oh

24
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Just don't fall, okay

25
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,740
Oh that is deep that is very very deep

26
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
Oh

27
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,140
Was more of a drop than I was expecting

28
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,629
Enderman there are so many I didn't think they ever came in

29
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,500
groups that big

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,388
No kidding it's like an enderman party I heard your voice

31
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:19,980
and thought I would come down to hell
