1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Patrick, let him go. It's not worth it.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,114
Sorry, Lucy. I didn't escape one monster just to let

3
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:07,400
another get away.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,028
I'm the only one who can stop the Wither Storm! Not you,

5
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:15,000
not the Order!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Don't make yourselves the villains in my story.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,400
You're not going anywhere.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This could have all been avoided.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you want to stop me, you'll have to catch me first.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Jesse, look out!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're not getting out of here that easy, Ivor.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm like the wind!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll cut through you if I have to!

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't...

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't tempt your fate.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,681
It didn't have to go this way, Jesse. You couldn't just let

17
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:10,000
me go.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now you see me! Now you...

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, Ivor. I'm sorry.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry, Ivor. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry, Ivor. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry, Ivor. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry, Ivor. I'm sorry.
