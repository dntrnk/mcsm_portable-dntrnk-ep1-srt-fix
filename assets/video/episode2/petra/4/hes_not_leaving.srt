1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm not letting him get away either.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm the only one who can stop the Wither Storm.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Not you, not the Order.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't make yourselves the villains in my story.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're not going anywhere.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This could have all been avoided.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you want to stop me, you'll have to catch me first.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Jesse, look out!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're not getting out of here that easy, I'm worried.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Climb like the wind!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll come through you if I have to.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't tempt your fate.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're not getting out of here that easy, I'm worried.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It didn't have to go this way, Jesse.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You couldn't just let me go.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now you see me, now you fall.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You
