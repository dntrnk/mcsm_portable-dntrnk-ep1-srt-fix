1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,320
I don't mean to worry you.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,047
I've just got something I want to discuss with you in

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:13,680
private.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:29,120
But let's split up.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,765
I feel bad about ditching everyone else, but I just wanted

7
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,840
to talk to you about this alone.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,320
Hey, whatever it is, I trust you.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,640
You can tell me.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,520
Thanks for being so understanding.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,269
You got me away from the wither storm, but I'm worried that

12
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,240
I didn't get away soon enough.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
What?

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,640
What is that?

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
What's wrong with your arm?

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,920
Do you know what wither is?

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
The wither?

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Of course, we've been...

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
No, Jesse.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,760
Just wither, or wither sickness, I guess.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,400
And I feel like it's just gonna keep getting worse.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,814
Well, we're gonna go back and tell the others we can get

23
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:17,180
help.

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,160
You can't tell anyone about this.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Grab my hand.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:34,160
I'll pull you up.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,520
Jesse, I just couldn't...

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Jesse?

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Are you okay?

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
Are you okay?
