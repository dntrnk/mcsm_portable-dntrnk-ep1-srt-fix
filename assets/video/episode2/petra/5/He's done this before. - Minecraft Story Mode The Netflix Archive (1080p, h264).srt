1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
It's one of his invisibility potions, he could be anywhere!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,343
Vanish all you want, slimeball. You're still not going

3
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:07,000
anywhere.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,925
End of the rail, Ivor. We're not letting you get away with

5
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:25,300
this.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,300
This one's on you, you beautiful!

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,300
There's no time for this.

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Jesse! Petra! Even more of you?

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Will this parade of useless babblers never cease?

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,300
What's going on?

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
We found Ivor. We stopped him.

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,300
Jesse did, anyway.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,300
False! You have stopped nothing.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,397
Aquarian, have you ever seen the effects of a splash potion

15
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,300
of slowness?

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,300
What?

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,300
All around...

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,300
You, Petra...

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,300
Get out!

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,276
Magnus and Ellegaard may think they can stop me, that they

21
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,300
can destroy the Witherstorm,

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,300
but they are mistaken, and it will cost them their lives.
