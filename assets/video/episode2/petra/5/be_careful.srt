1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can be anywhere, stay in your guard!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,375
Vanish all you want, slimeball! You're still not going

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,000
anywhere!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,625
End of the rail, Ivor. We're not letting you get away with

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,000
this.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This one's on you, you puffed up fool!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's no time for this.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jesse! Petra! Even more of you?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Will this parade of useless babblers never cease?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's going on?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We found Ivor. He stopped him.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Jesse did, anyway.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
False. You have stopped nothing.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,097
Aquarian, have you ever seen the effects of a splash potion

15
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:03,000
of slowness?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You bitch!

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You bitch!

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,214
Magnus and Ellegaard may think they can stop me, that they can

21
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:27,000
destroy the Witherstorm,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but they are mistaken, and it will cost them their lives.
