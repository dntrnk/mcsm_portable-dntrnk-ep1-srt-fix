1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
I bet we can find him. I'm very curious to see it. I've

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,940
never actually seen it work before

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,920
All right, there's your light my light

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,520
That's new

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,480
There he is

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,089
Sorin had his fortress deep inside the mountains after the

7
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,450
order broke up. That's where he went to keep doing his

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,260
experiments

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,788
Look, he invited me there a couple times, but it always

10
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,797
seemed a little weird, right? It always seemed a little

11
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:41,180
weird

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,932
Then let's stop hanging around here and go get us some

13
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:45,520
super TNT

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
I

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Bore is going to soren's we need to move

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,880
It's not too far we could probably make it on foot

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,449
Perfect. We can wait till tomorrow morning and travel with

18
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,500
a full day's sunlight

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,430
And is that thing catching up with us? I think I've had

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,020
enough with her store for one day

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,144
Thank you very much because getting caught out there in the

22
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,300
dark is so much better

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,248
Yeah, I don't want the with the storm catching up with us.

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:22,960
We should go now

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,780
Okay, everyone let's get moving

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,438
Jesse right? Oh, hello. We haven't had the chance to

27
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,020
acquaint ourselves properly

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,430
I hear that you saved your friend Petra from this wither

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:51,740
storm

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,723
Sounds like you're a pretty impressive individual. I'm just

31
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,366
doing my best to keep everyone safe. I can always

32
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,500
appreciate humility

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,192
I like you a slight tangent. What's the deal with your

34
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,340
friend Olivia?

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,180
I appreciate her enthusiasm, but she can be a little

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,180
Much sometimes

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,420
She's always very eager to jump in and help

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,622
Which is sweet, of course, though. Sometimes I wish she

39
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:19,860
would think a bit more before jumping in

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,460
Especially when she keeps getting in over her head
