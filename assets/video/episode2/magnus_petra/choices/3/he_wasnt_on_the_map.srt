1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He wasn't on the map.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm very curious to see it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've never actually seen it work before.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alright, there's your light, my light.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's new.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There he is.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sorin had his fortress deep inside the mountains.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,506
After the order broke up, that's where he went to keep

9
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:34,000
doing his experiments.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,972
Look, he invited me there a couple times, but it always

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:38,000
seemed a little...

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Weird, right? It always seemed a little weird.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,323
Then let's stop hanging around here and go get us some

14
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,000
super TNT.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Whoa.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Blue? Blue? That's Ivor!

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Ivor!

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ivor is going to Sorin's. We need to move.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not too far. We could probably make it on foot.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,580
Perfect. We can wait till tomorrow morning and travel with

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,000
a full day's sunlight.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And is that thing catching up with us?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,528
I think I've had enough wither storm for one day. Thank you

24
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:16,000
very much.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,257
Great, because getting caught out there in the dark is so

26
00:01:19,257 --> 00:01:20,000
much better.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,189
Yeah, I don't want the wither storm catching up with us. We

28
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,000
should go now.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, everyone, let's get moving.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Jesse, right?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, hello.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We haven't had the chance to acquaint ourselves properly.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,555
I hear that you saved your friend Petra from this wither

34
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:40,000
storm.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sounds like you're a pretty impressive individual.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm just doing my best to keep her safe.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sure you are.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sure you are.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sure you are.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sure you are.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sounds like you're a pretty impressive individual.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm just doing my best to keep everyone safe.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can always appreciate humility. I like you.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A slight tangent. What's the deal with your friend Olivia?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,873
I appreciate her enthusiasm, but she can be a little...

46
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,000
much sometimes.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She's always very eager to jump in and help.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,375
Which is sweet, of course, though sometimes I wish she

49
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,000
would think a bit more before jumping in.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Especially when she keeps getting in over her head.
