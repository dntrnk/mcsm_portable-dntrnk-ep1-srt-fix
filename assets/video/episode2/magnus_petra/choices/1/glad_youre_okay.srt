1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
It's such a relief to see you. I'm glad you're okay

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,334
You pulled me out of that wither storms crutches, and I ran

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:07,940
and ran and ran for the temple

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,520
If you hadn't saved me

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,562
Well, I owe you everything Jesse Wow did Gabriel get away,

6
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:17,040
too. Did you see?

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,975
It's all a blur, but the wither storm left almost nothing

8
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:21,360
behind

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,880
everything

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,880
Everyone was just gone

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,680
It even got Gabriel

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Wow

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Been a while since I've been here

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,160
What is she doing here

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,000
Call this a hunch, but do you two not like each other?

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,160
Right. I forgot to mention

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Olivia went on a little

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,840
Expedition of her own while you were gone and this

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,520
Olivia person

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Came back with her

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Did you know about this?

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,258
Jesse Jesse look I found Ella guard just hang on a sec.

23
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,920
Okay, I'll go figure out what's going on good

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,432
Easy now Olivia, let's try and play it cool. Hmm. So who

25
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,480

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,080
And why did you bring him with you?
