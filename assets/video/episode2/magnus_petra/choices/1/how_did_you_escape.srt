1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I don't understand. How did you escape?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,632
You pulled me out of that wither storm's crutches and I ran

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,120
and ran and ran for the temple

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
If you hadn't saved me

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
Well

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
I owe you everything jesse

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,240
Wow, did cabriel get away too? Did you see?

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,423
It's all a blur, but the wither storm left almost nothing

9
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:20,800
behind

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,120
everything

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Everyone was just gone

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
It even got cabriel

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,480
Wow, it's been a while since i've been here. Whoa

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,440
What is she doing here

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,320

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,120

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,560
