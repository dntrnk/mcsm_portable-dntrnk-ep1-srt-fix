00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,733
Olivia's one of my best friends. She's smart. She always

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:05,800
has a plan. Oh wow interesting

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,701
So why didn't you listen to her plan to come and recruit me

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:09,880
I?

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,219
Figured that we needed firepower and no one knows

6
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,700
destruction better than Magnus

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,132
The man does know how to blow things up with reckless

8
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:19,440
abandon. That's for sure

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,400
I'll do my best to not let it hurt my feelings

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Joke that was a joke

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Guys

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
I told you who's gonna catch up with us

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Really weren't kidding

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Not again

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,137
And hash all that out later come on we got to get out of

16
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,160
here not again

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,280
Sores isn't much farther we can make it

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,312
Am getting very tired of this weather storm agreed place

20
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:28,640

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Soaring really live down here so far from anyone

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Enchanting isn't it?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,900
Just don't fall okay

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,960
That is very very deep

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
I

29
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,160
Was more of a drop than I was expecting

30
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,107
There are so many I didn't think they ever came in groups

31
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:14,560
that big

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,932
No kidding it's like an Enderman party I heard your voice

33
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,340
and thought I would come down to hell

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You
