1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,836
I don't know if you caught this but she's like your biggest

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,760
fan. You probably just make her nervous

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,340
That's an excellent point hadn't thought about that

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,040
Seems like you respect her a lot

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,440
Why didn't you listen to her plan to come and recruit me?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,279
I figure that we needed firepower and no one knows

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,040
destruction better than Magnus

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,453
The man does know how to blow things up with reckless

9
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:23,780
abandon. That's for sure

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,720
I'll do my best to not let it hurt my feelings

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,280
Ha joke that was a joke

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Guys

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
I told you we're gonna catch up with this

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Really weren't kidding

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Again

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,800
I saw that out later. Come on. We got to get out of here

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,600
Not again, so it isn't much farther. We can make it

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,160
I

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,760
Am getting very tired of this weather storm agreed

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,761
Soren really live down here so far from anyone enchanting

21
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,920
isn't it?

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,400
Yeah, and I'm really not feeling those columns

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Oh

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,080
That is deep that is very very deep

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Oh

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,520
It was more of a drop than I was expecting

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,009
Enderman there are so many I didn't think they ever came in

28
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:18,880
groups that big

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,768
No kidding it's like an enderman party I heard your voice

30
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:25,360
and thought I would come down to hell
