1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,012
Olivia I just stay out of this but your friends right

2
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:05,400
Olivia. I've got this just fine on my own

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,700
People can we please focus on the bigger picture

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,894
We have a very hungry wither storm and the process of

5
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:17,200
turning the whole world into its dinner

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,779
Yeah, I'll admit that thing looked real nasty and I've seen

7
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,820
some nasty stuff in my time

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,212
Too much for you was it your usual brutish approach didn't

9
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:29,940
cut it. Hey, you weren't there

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,600
All right, you didn't see how this thing just tore

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,260
everything up. You've never seen anything like it

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,300
Would you two stop fighting whoa

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,620
Jesse's right. We need to find some way to stop that thing

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,460
I don't know if you've looked around yet

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,325
But this place isn't nearly the stronghold it used to be

16
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,860
most of our supplies are gone

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,220
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,477
Hate to say it but you have a point. Can we start crafting

19
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:01,500
some men? I don't think we got that kind of time

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,314
Only soren were here. He might have something we could use.

21
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,980
Oh Ellie not this again

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,340
There's something stronger than TNT

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,350
Soren had a kind of super TNT stronger and more explosive

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,580
than anything else in the world

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,620
the form it a bomb

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,302
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard all about the f-bomb before

27
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,481
well the for minibombs sounds perfect we should go get it

28
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:28,760
now

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,480
Well, there's a little problem there

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,260
We don't know where soren is

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
But you found us. Do you know where he is?

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Our map could locate him

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,980
Unless he's in the nether or the end but it's worth a shot
