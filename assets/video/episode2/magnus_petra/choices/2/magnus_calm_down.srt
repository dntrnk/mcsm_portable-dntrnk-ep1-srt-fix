1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Magnus, as the ruler of Boomtown, I command you to shut up.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Is that so?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
Uh, people, can we please focus on the bigger picture?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
We have a very hungry wither storm

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,300
in the process of turning the whole world into its dinner.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,800
Yeah, I'll admit. That thing looked real nasty.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,900
And I've seen some nasty stuff in my time.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,400
Too much for you, was it?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Your usual brutish approach didn't cut it?

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,300
Hey, you weren't there, all right?

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,100
You didn't see how this thing just tore everything up.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,500
You've never seen anything like it.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,700
Would you two stop fighting?

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Whoa!

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,500
Yikes. Jesse's right.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
We need to find some way to stop that thing.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,300
I don't know if you've looked around yet,

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,900
but this place isn't nearly the stronghold it used to be.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,900
Most of our supplies are gone.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,300
It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,300
I hate to say it, but you have a point.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,700
Can we start crafting some, then?

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,900
I don't think we got that kind of time.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,700
If only Soren were here,

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,500
he might have something we could use.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Oh, Ellie. Not this again.

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,100
There's something stronger than TNT?

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
Soren had a kind of super TNT.

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,700
Stronger and more explosive than anything else in the world.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,100
The Formidabomb.

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard all about the F-bomb before.

32
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,500
Well, the Formidabomb sounds perfect.

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,100
We should go get it now.

34
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,500
Well, there's a little problem there.

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
We don't know where Soren is.

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,900
But you found us.

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Do you know where he is?

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,700
Our map could locate him.

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,500
Unless he's in the nether or the end.

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
But it's worth a shot.
