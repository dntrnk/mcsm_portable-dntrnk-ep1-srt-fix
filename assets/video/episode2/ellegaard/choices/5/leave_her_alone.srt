1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,744
Well, that seems a little unfair to blame Olivia. It's not

2
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:04,400
her fault that she was so excited.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,350
How in the world did she get this assistant position in the

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,000
first place?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,147
Well, that's the thing. We're actually here to get your

6
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:12,600
help.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,800
There's a giant wither storm that's attacking the entire

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,200
world.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,200
A wither what? What are you talking about? Who sent you?

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
Gabriel sent me.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,405
Look, you both seem like very pleasant people who are prone

12
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:28,200
to fainting,

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,400
but I simply don't have the brain power for this.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm in the middle of my greatest project to date.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A powerful block, capable of altering reality itself.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
I've seen one of those before. It's a command block.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,237
Wait, wait, wait, wait. How do you know what a command

18
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:44,800
block is?

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,600
We've seen one up close before. It was Ivor's.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,800
He's done something terrible with it.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,412
The world needs the Order of the Stone. That's why we're

22
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:54,800
here.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,465
Sorry to bust your circuits, but the Order isn't really

24
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,600
together anymore.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
We sort of disassembled.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
That's actually kind of why we're here.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Gabriel's amulet.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,800
Yes, he gave it to me so that I could find the Order.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,661
Your wither storm problem was created by a command block,

30
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:16,000
yes?

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,109
That means a command block could be the perfect way of

32
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,800
beating it.

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
And maybe...

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Will you help me make one?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
It's going to work this time.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,800
I can feel it.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Right here, in my brain.

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I could help too.
