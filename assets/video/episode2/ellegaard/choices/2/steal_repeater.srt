1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh no, my machine! Oh my cow!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh no, your amazing invention.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You! You did this!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey, I am not taking credit for any of this.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That machine's been a cow death trap since block one.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, that's a step in the right direction.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bam, more open.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Switch is on.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, good, good.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wow, here it is.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ellegard's Redstone Laboratory.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Seems more like an entrance or a foyer or something.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't worry pal, we'll find her.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I just hope she can actually help us.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, let's go.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, let's go.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, let's go.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, let's go.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, let's go.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, let's go.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, let's go.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, let's go.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, let's go.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's not going to actually help us.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,625
That might be the last Redstone stuff I've ever seen in my

27
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,000
life.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can say that again.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She's moving a lot of different ingredients around here.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Man, look at all this, huh?

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,295
Whatever she's working on, if it requires all of these

32
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,000
ingredients, it must be something

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
really, really big.
