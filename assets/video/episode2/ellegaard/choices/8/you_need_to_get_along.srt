1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Yeah, and you two are going to have to get along, okay?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,280
We didn't even know you were gonna be here.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,480
That makes two of us then.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,400
But reversed for me.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,100
I got tired of waiting around, so I decided to go recruit

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,000
Magnus myself.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,562
It was kind of a crazy adventure, but it all worked out in

8
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:16,960
the end.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
And now I'm the king of Boomtown!

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,200
Boomtown?

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
That's the name of Magnus' kingdom.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
I had to beat him in a crazy tournament and-

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,200
Long story!

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,080
You had to be there.

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,200
Short version, epic battle of explosions and mayhem,

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,880
death-defying action, shenanigans, and pyrotechnics.

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Bada bing, bada boom!

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,195
Your friend here is kind of supreme ruler of my kingdom

19
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:42,960
now, you know what I mean?

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
Well, this is unexpected.

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm not entirely sure what you mean.

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,760
But I'm definitely sure that I don't like it.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,240
Yeah, show him some respect.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, you're sticking up for Magnus, that's very sweet.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,640
Yeah, he's sticking up for me.

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
It's because I'm really awesome and super cool.

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,480
I'll never understand your fans.
