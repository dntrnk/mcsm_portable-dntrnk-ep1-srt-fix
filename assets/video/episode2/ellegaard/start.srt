1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Heroes can come from unlikely beginnings.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,760
And broken friendships can lead to dark rivalry.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,163
When the world is in danger, fate calls on the ordinary to

4
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,400
do extraordinary deeds.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,835
But the question remains, will it be enough to save the

6
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:29,400
world?

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,167
This is so cool! The amount of engineering it must have

8
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,400
taken to do this?

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,706
Automated train tracks running all through the Nether?

10
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:54,400
Connecting all the different order members?

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,530
This is impressive! Thanks to these rails, we'll be there

12
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,400
in no time.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,209
If we don't get the order back together, the Witherstorm is

14
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,400
going to eat everything.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,007
We're gonna get to Ellegaard, get her to help us, and we're

16
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,400
gonna save the world.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,309
I hope you're right. We definitely stand a better chance

18
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:12,400
with Ellegaard's help.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Uh... Jesse!

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Whoa!

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
The minecart!

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Wait! More gas!

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Grrr!

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Do something about the gas!

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Okay, think fast, Jesse. What to choose?
