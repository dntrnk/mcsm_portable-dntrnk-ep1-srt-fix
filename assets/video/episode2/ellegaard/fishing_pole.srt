1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Seriously? Fishing?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
It could work.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Got it!

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, we're all set to go again.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Time to move, buddy. Let's go.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Hitting the power plants.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,353
I never doubted you for a second, but... but that was

9
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:40,000
incredible.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Maybe we have a chance of getting Dwellegarde after all.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Look! There's the sign! Redstonia! Redstonia, here we come!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,906
We're about to meet the greatest Redstone builders in the

13
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:00,000
world!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,866
Wow! Who would have thought that someday I'd really get to

15
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,000
visit Redstonia,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ellegaard's capital city of engineering. Incredible!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you think Ellegaard will be willing, you know, to help us?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Redstonia

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Redstonia

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Redstonia

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,154
Have you seen all these inventions? These inventors are all

22
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,000
incredible.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,452
I might know Redstone where we come from, but these people

24
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:25,000
are the real deal, Jesse.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,636
I mean, I don't even know how they're making some of these

26
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:29,000
things.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's rare for me.
