1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Heroes can come from unlikely beginnings.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,760
And broken friendships can lead to dark rivalry.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,163
When the world is in danger, fate calls on the ordinary to

4
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,400
do extraordinary deeds.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,835
But the question remains, will it be enough to save the

6
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:29,400
world?

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Woohoo!

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Aw, come on, Jesse. You're not even having a little fun?

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,900
I mean, I am!

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,400
Just don't lose track of why we're here, okay?

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,709
If we don't get the order back together, the Witherstorm is

12
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:57,900
going to eat everything.

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,284
That means we need to get to Magnus as soon as freaking

14
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:01,900
possible.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,900
You know what? You're right.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,525
We're gonna find Magnus, bring him back, and he'll totally

17
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,900
know how to blow that thing sky high.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,900
Uh, dude!

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Whoa!

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Ow, ow, ow!

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,900
The minecart!

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Why does it hate us so much?

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Hurry! Use something on that ghast!

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,900
Okay, think fast, Jesse. What to choose?
