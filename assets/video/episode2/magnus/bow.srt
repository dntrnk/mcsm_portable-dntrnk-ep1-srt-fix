1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That is like the perfect warmup for when we get to Boomtown.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Boomtown?

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah! Boomtown!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is it.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,452
I, uh, I think I'm gonna hold off on the whole going first

6
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,000
thing for a while, Jesse.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How about you take this one?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Careful, okay? We're on the step.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Whoa! You see that? Utter chaos, man.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your loot is mine, friggin'!

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll have to catch me first, Mammoth.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Whoa! Um, I hope they're okay.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,540
And if they're not, at least they died doing what they

15
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,000
loved.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, here you have it, Jesse.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Boomtown in all its glory. What do you think?

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,283
Wow, Boomtown sure does keep you on your toes. Exciting

19
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:36,000
stuff, huh?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, yeah, now you're getting it.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Dude, it's freaking glowing.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Dude, I think you're on fire.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Dude, I think you're on to something there.
