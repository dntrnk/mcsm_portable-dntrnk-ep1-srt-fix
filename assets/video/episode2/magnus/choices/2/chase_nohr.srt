1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The thief is mine, you take the one with the fishing pole.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Got it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,206
Sorry guys, but I've been trying to find Magnus for way too

4
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,000
long, so he'll just stop me now.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, later dingus!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Only one way out of a pit.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Axel!

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,052
Jess, there you are. So I totally courted that fisher dude

9
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:27,000
and they were all scared and scared.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Where is the amulet?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Stop right there!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How about no?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This bridge will take forever to punch through.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Luckily I think I found us a punch-free entrance.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, little amulet. Show me the way.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,192
Of course not sure what I'll do when I get there, but

17
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,000
that's future Nohr's problem.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I bet future Nohr is very successful.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Uh-oh!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh my god!

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ha! Nice! What did I tell you about teamwork?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What? But I'm the one who said we should work together.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No you didn't! Give me that!

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Give it back!

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Got it! I actually got it!

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Quick! Flush him out!

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh my god!

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,111
Axel Magnus is somewhere in that building above us. He's

29
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,000
gotta be close!

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Then quick! Toss me the amulet!

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,666
You're surrounded by creepers and they're gonna tear you

32
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,000
apart!

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well...

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Jesse, we need to move now!
