1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,636
I'll get the one with the fishing pole, you get the little

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,500
blue-haired creep.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Think fast!

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Whoa!

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,700
Your training is coming along nice and new.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,300
Just give me the amulet.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,600
Jeez, pal. No need to shout.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,700
Here you go.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My turn!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come on, kid.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,300
Kated, you're coming this way?

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Yeah, and she had the amulet again.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,800
Stop right there!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
How about no?

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
These bricks will take forever to punch through.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,000
Luckily, I think I found us a punch-free entrance.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, little amulet. Show me the way.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,214
Of course, not sure what I'll do when I get there, but

19
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:08,000
that's future Noor's problem.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
I bet future Noor is very successful.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Uh-oh!

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's going on?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
What did you know?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Uh-oh!

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ha! Nice! What did I tell you about teamwork?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
What? But I'm the one who said we should work together.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,000
No, you didn't. Give me that!

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Give it back!

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Got it! I actually got it!

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Quick! Flush it out!

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Huh?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,146
Max Old Magnus is somewhere in that building above us. He's

33
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:14,000
gotta be close!

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then quick! Cross me the amulet!

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,671
You're surrounded by briefers, and they're gonna tear you

36
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,000
apart!

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Jesse, we need to move now!
