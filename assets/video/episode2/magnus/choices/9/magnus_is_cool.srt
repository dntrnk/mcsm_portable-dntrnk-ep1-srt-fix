00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,333
Hey, come on Magnus is awesome. He's gonna help us stop

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,060
this weather storm. You really believe that?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,040
Wow

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,359
It was kind of crazy. Actually, I went to redstonia and

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,740
there were all these incredible engineers and inventors

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,436
It was a little intimidating actually, but Ellegaard's made me

7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,960
her protege. Well assistant for now

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,640
She might have well

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Embarrassed herself a tiny bit

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,665
Yeah, but after I pled my case she agreed to take me on as

11
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:33,040
her assistant and come back to help

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,040
Not bad, right? Well, I'm the king of boon town

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Very impressive

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,520
Ray it's Ellie and here I was just starting to enjoy myself

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,909
Hello, Magnus your voice is exactly as pleasant as I

16
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,560
remember which is to say not at all

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,911
My feelings is that the same way you're gonna use to save

18
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,520
the world

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,713
Why you're here to tell me how to do it better? Oh, I would

20
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,280
never dream of doing that

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,335
Unlike you I actually do things instead of just talking

22
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:15,170
about them. Hey, that's Ellegaard. You're talking to show her

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,080
some respect

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,240
Wow, you finally found yourself a live one. Hey

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,159
Your little devotees are usually a little more on the

26
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,560
brookish side leave her out of this magnus

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
This is between the two of us

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,700
Oh, I started ignoring her ages ago
