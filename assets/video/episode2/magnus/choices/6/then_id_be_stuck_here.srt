1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Yeah, but assuming I won, wouldn't I be stuck here then?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,360
Nah, you're not as legendary as me.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,680
Should be easy enough to throw another fighter.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,680
Just give up the crown with way lower level grievers.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,560
The trick is, don't become a legend.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,000
But looking at you, I don't think...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,440
Well, anyway.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,080
Oh, this is gonna be good.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
I'm actually excited about this.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,440
But we gotta make sure it looks legit.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,025
The Death Bowl has never seen the carnage that we're about

12
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:34,880
to create.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,520
Uh, what's the Death Bowl?

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,920
This is the Death Bowl!

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,120
I love playing in the pool!

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,320
Welcome, ladies and gentle grievers, to the Death Bowl!

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,280
In one corner we have Magnus, your king of boob-tell!

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
Prepare to defend this title and crown!

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
Some tiny welcome to the Death Bowl.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,440
The Grief Off to end all Grief Offs.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,000
How do you want to fake this?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
We'll start off small, then I'll throw some TNT at you.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Just let it graze you, then we'll call it a finish, alright?

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay, something about TNT. Awesome!

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
And you! What name do you go by?

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,560
They call me...

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,360
The Amulet Holder!

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
You heard the name, folks.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Give a big Death Bowl welcome to the...

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Amulet Holder!

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Then let's begin!

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,080
Opponents will craft their own griefing towers,

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,160
which they will then use to grief each other.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
The only rule is...

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
There are no rules!

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
No eye poking!

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Other than that, go crazy!

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Seriously.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,708
Amulet Holder, pick your building material, and Magnus,

40
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,160
you...

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Nah, I'm good. Brought my own supply.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Let the griefing begin!

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Some stone...

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Some...

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Pink wall?

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Eww!
