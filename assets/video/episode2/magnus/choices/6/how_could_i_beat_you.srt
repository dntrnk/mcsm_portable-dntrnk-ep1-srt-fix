1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
How would I ever beat you?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,000
Ha ha, I know right?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,700
But that's just it, you won't have to.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,400
Oh ho ho ho, this is gonna be good.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm actually excited about this.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
But we gotta make sure it looks legit.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,339
The Death Bowl has never seen the carnage that we're about

8
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:20,200
to create.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,800
Uh, what's the Death Bowl?

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,800
This is the Death Bowl!

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
I love this!

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
It's the Death Bowl!

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Welcome ladies and gentle-dreamers to the Death Bowl!

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
In one corner we have Magnus, your king of boob-tail.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Prepare to defend this title and crown.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
So tiny, welcome to the Death Bowl.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
The Grief Off to end all Grief Offs.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
How do you want to think this?

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,300
We'll start off small, then I'll throw some TNT at you.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,800
Just let it graze you, then we'll call it a finish, alright?

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Okay, something about TNT, awesome!

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,800
And you, what name do you go by?

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
They call me the Amulet Holder.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
You heard the name folks.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Give a big Death Bowl welcome to the Amulet Holder!

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Then let's begin!

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,136
Opponents will craft their own griefing towers which they

28
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:39,800
will then use to grief each other.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,800
The only rule is, there are no rules.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
No eye poking.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Other than that, go crazy!

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,341
Seriously, Amulet Holder, pick your building material and

33
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,800
Magnus, you...

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Nah, I'm good. Brought my own supply.

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Let the Griefing begin!

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Some stone, some pink...
