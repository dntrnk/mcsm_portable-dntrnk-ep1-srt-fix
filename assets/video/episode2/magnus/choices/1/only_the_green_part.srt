1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yeah, well, the green part is...

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
It's weird.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah...

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,946
And look, it glows brighter when I move it in certain

5
00:00:08,946 --> 00:00:09,500
directions.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Eeeasy does it. Easy.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Maybe to the left.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
No, the right. I mean, your left.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Right, I mean.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Your right.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
About left.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Axle?

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
You're stressing me out with that.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Whoa.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Whoa!

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Yeah.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ding, ding, ding.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Looks like that spire is where we'll find Magnus.

19
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Hey there, new people.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You, uh...

21
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
You said you know where Magnus is?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Just leave us alone, okay? It's none of your business.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Hmm.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,285
I'm afraid to say that you're just making me wonder even

25
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,000
more what the heck is up with that thing.

26
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
What's going on?

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
North-Alice noobs. They think they can find Magnus.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Jessie?

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Why don't you help us, huh?

30
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I promise it's to help save the world.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Yeah...

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sounds complicated.

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I prefer you just handing over the thingy.

34
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Get back here with that.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,437
I am North, and I shall use this amulet to find Magnus and

36
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,500
become the new world!

37
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Move!

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Watching you!

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey, are they going the same way?

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,000
They're working together.

41
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
This is just how we do it in Boomtown.

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Which one took the amulet?
