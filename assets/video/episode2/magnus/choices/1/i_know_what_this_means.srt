1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This glow, I think I know what it means.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,446
And look, it glows brighter when I move it in certain

3
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:07,000
directions.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Easy does it. Easy.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Maybe to the left. No, the right. I mean your left.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Right, I mean. Your right. About left.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Axle? You're stressing me out with that.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Whoa. Whoa.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,641
Ding, ding, ding. Looks like that spire is where we'll find

10
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:28,000
Magnus.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hey there, new people.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You, uh, you said you know where Magnus is?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just leave us alone, okay? It's none of your business.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,718
Hmm. I'm afraid to say that you're just making me wonder

15
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:48,000
even more what the heck is up with that thing.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's going on?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,606
North bouts of noobs. Who would think they could find

18
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:54,000
Magnus?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I promise it's to help save the world.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,294
Yeah, sounds complicated. I prefer you just handing over

22
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:04,000
the thingy.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Get back here with that.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,075
I am North, and I shall use this amulet to find Magnus and

25
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,000
become the new world!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Watching you!

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey, are they going the same way? They're working together.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is just how we do it in Boomtown.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Which one took the amulet?
