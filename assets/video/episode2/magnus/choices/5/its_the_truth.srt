1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
Magnus, every word of what I'm saying is true. You have to

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:04,400
believe me.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,360
Okay, okay, you sold me.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm in.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,761
Oh, but we might have a little bit of a problem getting out

6
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:22,360
of here.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800
You're Magnus. You can just walk out of here.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,083
Hello, I don't know if you've looked around this place, but

9
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,040
it's kind of full of griefers.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,880
But that's kind of awesome, right?

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,954
No, you've heard about the whole challenging the king for

12
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,720
his crown thing, right? It's like their thing.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,160
So long as I'm king, I can't leave this tower.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,320
But you're Magnus. No one can beat you.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,440
And that's the problem. Simply put, that's life.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
As king of Boomtown.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Just choose a new king and then come with us.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,468
Look, I've beaten them dozens of times and none are worthy.

19
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,680
They'll see right through it.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,640
But you, huh, you're the newcomer with the gold amulet.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,733
By now, there'll probably be all sorts of rumors about how

22
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,640
awesome you are.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
If you beat me, then I'll be able to leave.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Can't believe I didn't think of it before.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,640
They're gonna call this the fight of the century.
