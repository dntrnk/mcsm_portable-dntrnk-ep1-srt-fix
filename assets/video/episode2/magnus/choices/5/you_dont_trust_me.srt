1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you that paranoid? Do you really not trust anyone?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That's how I've survived this long.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Please just trust us, just for a minute, okay?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, okay, you sold me!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm in.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,338
Oh, but we might have a little bit of a problem getting out

7
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:27,000
of here.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Huh? You're Magnus. You can just walk out of here.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,933
Hello. I don't know if you've looked around this place, but

10
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,000
it's kind of full of griefers.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But that's kind of awesome, right?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,836
No. You've heard about the whole challenging the king for

13
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:50,000
his crown thing, right? It's like their thing.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So long as I'm king, I can't leave this tower.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But you're Magnus. No one can beat you.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,117
And that's the problem. Simply put, that's life as king of

17
00:01:03,117 --> 00:01:04,000
Boomtown.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Just choose a new king and then come with us.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,466
Look, I've beaten them dozens of times, and none are

20
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:16,000
worthy. They'll see right through it.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But you, huh, you're the newcomer with the gold amulet.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,081
By now there'll probably be all sorts of rumors about how

23
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,000
awesome you are.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you beat me, then I'll be able to leave.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Can't believe I didn't think of it before!

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They're gonna call this the fight of the century!
