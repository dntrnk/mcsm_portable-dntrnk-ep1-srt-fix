1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,219
Hey, no Griefer's here. No way. We came from way out of

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,600
town to find you.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,809
Oh, really? I mean, that guy? He's got Griefer written all

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:12,880
over him.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,121
Yeah, well, that's because he's your biggest fan. Look at

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:17,360
him.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,240
I mean, not like, biggest fan.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,560
Right. So tell me something not Griefer's. How'd you find

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:26,880
me?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,960
Gabriel sent us on this mission.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,551
Gabriel? You're seriously telling me you're buddy-buddy

12
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,720
with Gabriel.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,960
You know how often people try to tell me that one.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,920
This is all sounding pretty weird, dudes.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,760
Who are you, Bill? Why are you here?

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
The world is being destroyed.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,560
You have me intrigued. Go on.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,315
There's a huge monster eating up the entire world and

19
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:01,200
nothing can stop it.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,760
That's why Gabriel told us to reunite the order.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,095
Magnus, you gotta come with us. You might be the only

22
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:06,800
chance we have.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,842
Give me one reason why, for even a second, I should come

24
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:12,400
with you.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,701
You're supposed to be a hero, Magnus, and right now, the

26
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,880
world needs a hero.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,960
You can come with us and help stop this disaster.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,752
All this stuff you've told me, you expect me to just take

29
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,000
your word for it?

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
Two strangers with wild stories.

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,720
And nothing to show for it.

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,400
Except an amulet that's not theirs.
