1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're here to ask for your help.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Uh-huh, uh-huh, sure.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,508
So you're not a couple of Grievers here to catch me

4
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,000
unawares?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Because, haha, let me tell ya.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I mean, that guy?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He's got Griever written all over it.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,672
Yeah, well that's because he's your biggest fan. Look at

9
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:20,000
him!

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I mean, not like, biggest fan.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right. So tell me something not Grievers.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How'd you find me?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Gabriel sent us on this mission.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Gabriel? Hahaha.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're seriously telling me you're buddy-buddy with Gabriel?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You know how often people try to tell me that one.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is all sounding pretty weird, dudes.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who are you really? Why are you here?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The world is being destroyed.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You have me intrigued. Go on.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,880
There's a huge monster eating up the entire world, and

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,000
nothing can stop it.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's why Gabriel told us to reunite the Order.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,111
Magnus, you've gotta come with us. You might be the only

25
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,000
chance we have.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,393
Give me one reason why, for even a second, I should come

27
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,000
with you.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,421
You're supposed to be a hero, Magnus, and right now, the

29
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,000
world needs a hero.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can come with us and help stop this disaster.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,320
All this stuff you've told me. You expect me to just take

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
your word for it?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Two strangers with wild stories.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And nothing to show for it.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Except an amulet that's not theirs.
