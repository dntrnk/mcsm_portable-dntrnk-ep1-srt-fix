1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,631
Luck sometimes visits the most unskilled of us, but it

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:04,640
never lingers.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,521
Skill, mastery, these are the things that will see you

4
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,240
defeated!

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Magnus, craft a cannon!

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,740
Yeah! Finish it with a cannon!

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,740
If it's a cannon you want, it's a cannon you'll get!

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,740
Yep, he's completely lost it.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,240
Dude's going for the kill.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,554
Jesse, you'd better craft the, I don't know, greatest thing

11
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:28,240
in your life, like right now!

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Well, there's still some material in the chest.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,480
That's it, Jesse, go!

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Actually, check it out.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
That should hold him.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah, it's, yeah, um, yeah, it might do, but Jesse, look!

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Whoa!

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Supposed to throw the fight.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
No!

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,720
Jesse, you down!

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Get him!

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
No, leave it out!

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Stop! I got this little stuff!

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Coming your way!

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I got you a bow and some arrows!

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
A bow? In a cannon fight?

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Actually, there are all sorts of cliched lines about this.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Yeah, but the TNT, inside the cannon!

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
TNT plus arrow.

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Oh yeah!

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Let me see how well you slide!

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
How bad!

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
I got you, I got you!

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Man, there's no foolishness right now.

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Hey Magnus!

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Yeah, short stub?

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Flying pig jokes are totally played out.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
No!

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
We have a winner!

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,960
The Amulet Holder!

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Can I say something there, champ?

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,435
It's just the winner sometimes, I don't know, gives a

43
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:01,960
speech.

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Pontificates, orates, say something.
