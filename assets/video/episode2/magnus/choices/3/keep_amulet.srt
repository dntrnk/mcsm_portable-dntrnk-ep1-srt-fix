1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,565
Actually, no offense, but I'm not letting this thing out of

2
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:05,500
my sight or my hand ever again.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,800
Don't worry, man, I got this.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Okay, well hurry. I'll try and cover you.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
Guys! Hey, guys, I've got the ambulance.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,270
Hey! I hate all the things that guy's saying! It makes me

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:20,800
so mad!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come on!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, boy!

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Jesse, you made it!

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You don't need to sound so surprised.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Everything go okay?

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Long story. Lots of throwing eggs at griefers.

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, sounds exciting.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Totally was. You still got the amulet?

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Yep, let's go. Look out for booby traps, okay?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh!

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,676
You were completely surrounded by hundreds of hidden death

19
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:39,000
traps.

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
One step closer, and...

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
It's madness! We totally got caught by madness!

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ah, oh. I think we're gonna die now.

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Did you really think you could sneak up on me?

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,000
Ha! You're two of the worst griefers I've ever met.

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
And a pig? Really? Hardly stealthy.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going going to you, pork chop!
