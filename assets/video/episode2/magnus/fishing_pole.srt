1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It could work.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're gonna die.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Got it!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes!

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Time to move, buddy. Let's go.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,166
You were awesome, Jesse. With that gasp and chasing the

8
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,000
mine cart.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,344
That is like the perfect warm-up for when we get to

10
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,000
Boomtown.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Boomtown? Yeah! Boomtown!

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is it.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,701
I think I'm gonna hold off on the whole going first thing

14
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,000
for a while, Jesse.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How about you take this one?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just be careful, okay?

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
On the step.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go!

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Whoa! You see that? Utter chaos, man.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You'll lose his mind, friggin'.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You'll have to catch me first, Bandlefoot.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Whoa! I hope they're okay.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,311
And if they're not, at least they died doing what they

24
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,000
loved.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, here you have it, Jesse. Boomtown in all its glory.

26
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you think?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,283
Wow, Boomtown sure does keep you on your toes. Exciting

28
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,000
stuff, huh?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, yeah, now you're getting it.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dude, it's freaking glowing.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Dude, I think you're on to something there.
