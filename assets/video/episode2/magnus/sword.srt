1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Time to move, buddy.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You were awesome, Jesse.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,916
With that gasp and chase in the mine cart, that is like the

5
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,000
perfect warm up for when

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we get to Boomtown.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Boomtown?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, Boomtown!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is it.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,425
I think I'm going to hold off on the whole going first

11
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:55,000
thing for a while, Jesse.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How about you take this one?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't be careful, okay?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wrong step.

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Bam, bam, bam...

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Stella.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Are you all here?

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,400
Step.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm gonna go get some food.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Whoa, you see that?

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Utter chaos, man.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Your loot is mine, friggin'.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
You'll have to catch me first, Mammoth.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Whoa, I hope they're okay.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,940
And if they're not, at least they died doing what they

39
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,400
loved.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Well, here you have it, Jesse.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Boomtown in all its glory.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
What do you think?

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Wow, Boomtown sure does keep you on your toes.

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Exciting stuff, huh?

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Yeah, yeah, now you're getting it.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Dude, it's freaking glowing.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Dude, I think you're on to something there.
