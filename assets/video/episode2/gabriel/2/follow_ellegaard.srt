1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Gabriel, are you okay?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,807
I know it's not the best time and I don't want to worry

3
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:14,823
you, but there's something I'd like to discuss with you in

4
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:16,000
private, Jesse.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But let's split up.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,009
I'm aware that letting them head off alone was risky, but I

7
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:37,000
need to talk to you about a private matter.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey, whatever it is, I trust you. You can tell me.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you for being so understanding.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,392
I'm so glad to see my old friends together again. I don't

11
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:51,000
want to ruin it with this.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,990
You may have succeeded in getting me away from the Wither

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,000
Storm, but I fear it was already too late.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is that? What's wrong with your arm?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Tell me. Do you know what Wither is?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The Wither? Of course, we've been-

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,161
No, just Wither. Or Wither's sickness, to be more

19
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:13,000
descriptive.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,653
It is something I've contracted before in my travels, but

21
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:18,000
it always wears off.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,891
It seems that Ivar's monster exudes a Wither sickness that

23
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,000
is decidedly more fatal.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,723
Well, we're going to go back and tell the others we can get

25
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,000
help.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, Jesse. You can't tell anyone about this.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What? Creeper, look out!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Take my hand. I'll pull you up.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,600
My strength is compromised! I couldn't maintain my hold!

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm so sorry!

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jesse, are you alright?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you hurt, Jesse?
