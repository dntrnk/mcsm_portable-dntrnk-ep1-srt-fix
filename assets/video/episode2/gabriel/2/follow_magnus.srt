1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm not sure.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Gabriel, are you okay?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,590
I know it's not the best time, and I don't want to worry

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,000
you.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,144
But there's something I'd like to discuss with you in

6
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:15,000
private, Jesse.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:29,400
But let's split up.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,064
I'm aware that letting them head off alone was risky, but I

9
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,680
need to talk to you about

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,240
a private matter.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,920
Hey, whatever it is, I trust you.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
You can tell me.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Thank you for being so understanding.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm so glad to see my old friends together again.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,880
I don't want to ruin it with this.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
What?

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,806
You may have succeeded in getting me away from the wither

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,080
storm, but I fear it was already

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,080
too late.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
What is that?

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
What's wrong with your arm?

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Tell me.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,120
Do you know what wither is?

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
The wither?

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Of course, we've been-

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
No, just wither.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,800
Or wither's sickness, to be more descriptive.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,629
It is something I've contracted before in my travels, but

29
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:18,040
it always wears off.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,155
It seems that Ivar's monster exudes a wither's sickness

31
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,400
that is decidedly more fatal.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,226
Well, we're going to go back and tell the others we can get

33
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:29,660
help.

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,360
No, Jesse.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,160
You can't tell anyone about this.

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
What?

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Creeper, look out!

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Take my hand.

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I'll pull you up!

40
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
My strength is compromised!

41
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
I couldn't maintain my hold.

42
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
I'm so sorry.

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm sorry, Jesse.

45
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Jesse, are you alright?

59
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Are you hurt, Jesse?
