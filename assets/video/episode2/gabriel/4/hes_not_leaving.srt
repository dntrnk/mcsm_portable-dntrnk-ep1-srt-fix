1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm not letting you get away.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm the only one who can stop the Witherstorm.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Not you, not the Order.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't make yourselves the villains in my story.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Stay and fight, you...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This could have all been avoided.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you want to stop me, you'll have to catch me first.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He's using a potion of swiftness.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We mustn't let him escape.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'd like to win.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Out of it.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How can I shoot you if I have to?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't tempt your fate.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You didn't have to go this way, Jesse.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You could have just let me go.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now you see me, now you...

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You
