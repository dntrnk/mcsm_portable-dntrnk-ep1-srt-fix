1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Just let him go, Gabriel. He's not worth it.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm sorry, Jesse, but I can't just let him live.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm the only one who can stop the Wither Storm!

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,600
Not you, not the Order!

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
Don't make yourselves the villains in my story.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,800
Stay and fight, you...

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
This could have all been avoided.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,000
If you want to stop me, you'll have to catch me first!

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,800
Look out, Jesse! He's using a potion of swiftness!

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
We mustn't let him escape!

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
I'd like to win!

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Out of it!

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
I'll cut through you if I have to!

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,600
Don't tempt your fate.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No!

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
It didn't have to go this way, Jesse.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,600
You could have just let me go.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Now you see me, now you...
