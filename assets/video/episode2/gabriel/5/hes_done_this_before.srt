1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
It's one of his invisibility potions, he could be anywhere!

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,500
Invisible or not, he isn't going to get by me.

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,100
Please, Ivor, just stand down!

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,100
This one's on you, you puffed up fool!

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
There's no time for this!

6
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Jesse! Gabriel!

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,100
Even more of you?

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Will this parade of useless babblers never cease?

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,100
What's going on?

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
You found Ivor, we stopped him.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
False!

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
You have stopped nothing.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
A query.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,616
Have you ever seen the effects of a splash potion of

15
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:02,100
slowness?

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,100
What?

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm coming around.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,100
You big jerk!

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Get me out!

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Magnus and Ellegaard may think that Ivor is a monster,

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,915
Ellegaard may think they can stop me, that they can destroy

22
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:25,100
the wither storm,

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,100
but they are mistaken, and it will cost them their lives.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,100
you
