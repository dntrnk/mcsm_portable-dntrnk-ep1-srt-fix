1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He could be anywhere, stay on your guard!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Invisible or not, he isn't going to get by me.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please, I would. Just stand down.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's no time for this.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Jesse! Gabriel!

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even more of you?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Will this parade of useless babblers never cease?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What's going on?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We found Ivor. We stopped him.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
False. You have stopped nothing.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A query.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not sure what's going on.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sure he's not going to make it.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
False. You have stopped nothing.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A query.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,354
Have you ever seen the effects of a splash potion of

17
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,000
slowness?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm falling around.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You big jug.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Magnus and the other guard may think they can stop me,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that they can destroy the Wither Storm,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but they are mistaken, and it will cost them their lives.
