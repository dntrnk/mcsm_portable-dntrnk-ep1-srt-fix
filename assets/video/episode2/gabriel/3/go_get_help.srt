1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,809
Go and find the others. Hopefully you can find a way to get

2
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:04,000
down to me or something.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Time to be a hero again.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Stay safe. I'll find a way down to you.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey, show yourself. Who's there?

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You. Trying to interfere with my plans again, I see.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you doing down here?

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Being rudely interrupted by you, clearly.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm here with the order to find Soren's super TNT.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're going to take down your wither storm.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to take down your wither storm.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm going to take down your wither storm.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to take down your wither storm.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to take down your wither storm.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Super TNT, we're going to take down your wither storm.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,903
The order? Believe me, that plan will blow up in their

17
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:36,000
faces in more ways than one.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They cannot help you. But me? I choose not to.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sorry, Ivor. I'm...

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Stop right there, Ivor!

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gabriel! You're alive!

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,612
Against all your best efforts, Ivor. Look at what you've

23
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,000
done.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I never dreamt that even you could be this twisted.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Save your posturing, Gabriel.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,043
We both know that words have always been hollow, just like

27
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:04,000
the order.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They're not going anywhere, Ivor. At least not in one piece.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,230
Your threats pass harmlessly through me, but this sword

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,000
will pass through you.
